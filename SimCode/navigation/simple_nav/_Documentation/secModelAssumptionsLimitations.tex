\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}

The direct assumption behind the simple nav module, is that the random walk produced by a Gauss-Markov process can accurately model the uncertainties of a real sensor. 
Generally, real sensor noise is a combination of bias, white noise, 
and brown noise.  In order to provide this, a second-order 
Gauss-Markov process model was added to the simulation utilities that allows 
the user to configure a random walk process.
