\section{Test Description and Success Criteria}


\subsection{Test location}

The unit test for the simple\_nav module is located in:\\

\noindent
{\tt SimCode/navigation/simple\_nav/UnitTest/SimpleNavUnitTest.py} \\
\\

\subsection{Subtests}

\noindent This unit test is designed to functionally test the simulation model 
outputs as well as get complete code path coverage.  The test design is broken 
up into three main parts:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Error Bound Enforcement: The simulation is run for 2.4 hours and the 
   error bounds for all of the signals }
\item{Error Bound Usage: The error signals are checked for all of the model 
   parameters over the course of the simulation to ensure that the error gets 
   to at least 75\% of its maximum error bound at some point to make sure that 
   it isn't stuck around zero.}
\item{Corner Case Check: The simulation is intentionally given bad inputs to 
   ensure that it alerts the user and does not crash.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test success criteria}

These tests are considered to pass if during the whole simulation time of 144 minutes,
all the variables need to say within an allowable statistical error. This means that they
must stay within their 1-sigma bounds $30\%$ of the time.

These sigma bounds are defined in Table~\ref{tab:sigmas}. These are chosen in regard to
the simulation's parameters and their orders of magnitude.
