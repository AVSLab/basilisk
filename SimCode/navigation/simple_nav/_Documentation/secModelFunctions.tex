\section{Model Functions}

This module allows the user to set the bounds, and the standard deviations for:

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] The spacecraft's postiion
\item[-] The spacecraft's velocity
\item[-] The spacecraft's attitude
\item[-] The spacecraft's attitude rate
\item[-] The sun direction
\item[-] The $\Delta $V
\end{itemize}

This allows the user to control the noise that is desired on the signals.
