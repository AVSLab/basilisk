\section{Model Functions}

This module allows the user to set the bounds, and the standard deviations for:

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] The spacecraft's postiion
\item[-] The spacecraft's velocity
\item[-] The spacecraft's attitude
\item[-] The spacecraft's attitude rate
\item[-] The sun direction
\item[-] The $\Delta $V
\end{itemize}

The user can set the noise levels on each of these parameters independently. 



\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}

The direct assumption behind the simple nav module, is that the random walk produced by a Gauss-Markov process can accurately model the uncertainties of a real sensor. 
Generally, real sensor noise is a combination of bias, white noise, 
and brown noise.  In order to provide this, a second-order 
Gauss-Markov process model was added to the simulation utilities that allows 
the user to configure a random walk process.
