\section{Test Parameters}

The test used for the simple navigation tests the statistics of the Gauss Markov process, making sure that we are getting the variability we want. In order to do so, no specific scenario is necessary. Therefore the position of the spacecraft and the sun were set generically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] The vehicle position is $\begin{bmatrix}10000 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T$
   \item[-] The Sun position is  $\begin{bmatrix}10000 & 10000 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T$
    \end{itemize}
