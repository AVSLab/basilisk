\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}

\subsection{Assumptions}

The Thruster module assumes that the thruster is thrusting exactly along it's position axis. Even if the position is dispersed, the thrust will be constant along that dispersed axis and will not vary.

\subsection{Limitations}

The ramps in the thrusters modules are made by defining a set of elements to the ramp. They therefore form, by definition, a piecewise-linear ramp. If enough points are added, this will strongly ressemble a polynomial, but the ramps are in essence piecewise constant.
