\section{Model Functions}

The Thrusters module contains methods allowing it to perform several tasks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Set thrusters}: Define and set several thrusters with different parameters, and locations. Parameters include: Minimum On-Time, $I_{sp}$, direction of thrust...
	\item \textbf{Ramp On/Off}: Define ramps that model the imperfect on time and off time for a thruster
	\item \textbf{Compute Forces and Torques}: Gets the forces and torques on the SpaceCraft given the previous definitions
	\item \textbf{Compute mass flow rate }: Computes the time derivative of the mass using $I_{sp}$ and Earth's gravity
\end{itemize}
