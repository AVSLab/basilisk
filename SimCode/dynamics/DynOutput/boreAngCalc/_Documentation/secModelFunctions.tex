\section{Model Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Compute Output Data}: This method computes the output structure for messaging. The miss angle is absolute distance between the desired body point and the specified structural vector. The azimuth angle is the angle between the y pointing axis and the desired pointing vector projected into the y/z plane.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}

When the miss angle goes to 0$^{\circ}$ the azimuth angle is ill defined. The model will default to setting the azimuth angle to 0$^{\circ}$
