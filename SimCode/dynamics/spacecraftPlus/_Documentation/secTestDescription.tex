\section{Test Description and Success Criteria}
This test is located in \tt SimCode/dynamics/HingedRigidBodies/UnitTest/\newline
test\_hingedRigidBodyStateEffector.py. In this integrated energy and momentum are the primary methods for validation. Depending on the scenario, however, there are different success criteria. These are outlined in the following list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gravity and no damping scenario:
	\subitem Conservation of orbital angular momentum
	\subitem Conservation of orbital energy
	\subitem Conservation of rotational angular momentum
	\subitem Conservation of rotational energy
	\subitem Achieving the expected final attitude
	\item No gravity and no damping scenario:
\subitem Conservation of orbital angular momentum
\subitem Conservation of orbital energy
\subitem Conservation of rotational angular momentum
\subitem Conservation of rotational energy
\subitem Achieving the expected final attitude
\subitem Achieving the expected final position
\subitem Conservation of velocity of center of mass
	\item No gravity with damping scenario:
\subitem Conservation of orbital angular momentum
\subitem Conservation of orbital energy
\subitem Conservation of rotational angular momentum
\subitem Conservation of velocity of center of mass

\end{itemize}
