\newcommand{\summary}{The hinged rigid body class is an instantiation of the state effector abstract class. The integrated test is validating the interaction between the hinged rigid body module and the rigid body hub that it is attached to. In this case, a hinged rigid body has a diagonal inertia tensor and is attached to the hub by a single degree of freedom torsional hinged with a linear spring constant and linear damping term. The integrated tests has three scenarios it is testing: one with gravity and damping, one without gravity and without damping, and one without gravity with damping . In the first two cases orbital energy, orbital momentum, rotational energy, and rotational angular momentum should all be conserved. In the last case only orbital momentum and rotational momentum should be conserved. This integrated test validates for both scenarios that all of these paramters are conserved.}
