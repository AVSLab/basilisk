\section{Model Functions}

This module is intended to be used an approximation to a flexing body attached to the spacecraft. Examples include solar arrays, antennas, and other appended bodies that would exhibit flexing behavior. Below is a list of functions that this model performs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Should be a first-order approximation to a flexing body
	\item Is developed in such a way that does not require constraints to be met (or that could eventually diverge)
	\item Compute it's contributions to the mass properties of the spacecraft
	\item Adhere to the back substitution form and provide matrix contributions for the back substitution method
	\item Compute it's derivatives for $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$
	\item Add energy and momentum contributions to the spacecraft
\end{itemize}
