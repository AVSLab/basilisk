\section{User Guide}

This section is to outline the steps needed to setup a reaction wheel state effector in python using Basilisk.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Import the reactionWheelStateEffector class: \newline \textit{import reactionWheelStateEffector}
	\item Create an instantiation of a reaction wheel state effector: \newline \textit{rws = reactionWheelStateEffector.ReactionWheelStateEffector()}
	\item Finally, add the reaction wheel object to your spacecraftPlus:\newline
	\textit{scObject.addStateEffector(rws)}. See spacecraftPlus documentation on how to set up a spacecraftPlus object. 
\end{enumerate}
