%README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.
%This template should be used to document all Basilisk modules.
%Updated 20170711 - S. Carnahan
%
%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
%-All edits should be made in one of:
%—header.tex
%— modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
%— modelDescription.tex
%— modelFunctions.tex
%— revisionTable.tex
%— testDescription.tex
%— testParameters.tex
%— testResults.tex
%— user_guide.tex
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the suer guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{The gravity effector module is responsible for calculating the effects of gravity from a body on a spacecraft. A spherical harmonics model and implementation is developed and described. A unit test has been written and run which tests basic input/output, single-body gravitational acceleration, and multi-body gravitational acceleration.}

\input{secModelDescription.tex} %This section includes mathematical models, code description, etc.

\input{secModelFunctions.tex} %This includes a concise list of what the module does.

\input{secModelAssumptionsLimitations.tex} %This explains the assumptions made to reach the final mathematical implementation of the model and how those assumptions limit the model's usefulness.

\input{secTestDescription.tex} %This explains the unit test for the model. I.e. what features are tested and how. It may also include test tolerances, etc.

\input{secTestParameters.tex}

\input{secTestResults.tex} %This displays the test results. This includes both pass/fail statements as well as visual outputs via AutoTeX

\input{secUserGuide.tex} %This section is to provide advice to users on necessary/useful inputs and best practices.

\bibliography{bibliography.bib} %This includes references used and mentioned.
