\newcommand{\summary}{The radiation pressure module is responsible for calculating the dyamic effects of radiation pressure on a spacecraft. Effects can be calculated either by use of a simplified ``cannonball" method or table look-up. A unit test has been written which checks both calculation methods against expected output values. The code is working fully and providing accurate results.}
