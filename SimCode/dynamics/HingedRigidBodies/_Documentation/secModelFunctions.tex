\section{Model Functions}

This module is intended to be used an approximation to a flexing body attached to the spacecraft. Examples include solar arrays, antennas, and other appended bodies that would exhibit flexing behavior. Below is a list of functions that this model performs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute it's contributions to the mass properties of the spacecraft
	\item Provides matrix contributions for the back substitution method
	\item Compute it's derivatives for $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$
	\item Adds energy and momentum contributions to the spacecraft
\end{itemize}
