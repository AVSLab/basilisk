\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}

\subsection{Assumptions}

The equations of motion class {\tt DynamicalObject} is assumed to respond to the method  {\tt equationsOfMotion}.  The integrator then integrates the system forward in time one BSK time step.  

\subsection{Limitations}

Currently only fixed-time step integrators have been implemented.  However, the architecture allows for variable time-step integrators to be implemented as long as their integration time step does not exceed the BSK time step setup for the dynamic equations of motion solving task.
