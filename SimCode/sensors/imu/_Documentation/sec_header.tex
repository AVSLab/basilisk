\newcommand{\summary}{The Basilisk IMU module is responsible for producing sensed body rates and acceleration from calculated values. The IMU module applies Gauss-Markov process noise to the true body rates and acceleration. A unit test has been written which validates MRP switching, static bias, process noise, discretization, saturation, spacecraft center of mass (CoM) offset, sensor misalignment, and bias walk bounds for both the gyroscope and accelerometer.}
