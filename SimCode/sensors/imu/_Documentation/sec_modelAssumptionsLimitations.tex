\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
This code makes assumptions which are common to IMU modeling.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Error Inputs}: Because the error models rely on user inputs, these inputs are the most likely source of error in IMU output. Instrument bias would have to be measured experimentally or an educated guess would have to be made. The Guass-Markov noise model has a well-known assumptions and is generally accepted to be a good model for this application.
