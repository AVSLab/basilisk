\section{Model Functions}
The mathematical description of the IMU are implemented in imu\_sensor.cpp. This code performs the following primary functions
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Spacecraft State Measurement}: The code provides measurements of the spacecraft state (angular and linear).
	\item \textbf{Bias Modeling}: The code adds instrument bias and bias random walk to the signals.
	\item \textbf{Noise Modeling}: The code calculates noise according to the Gauss Markov model if the user asks for it and provides a perturbation matrix.
	\item \textbf{Discretization}: The code discretizes the signal to emulate real digital instrumentation. The least significant bit (LSB) can be set by the user.
	\item \textbf{Saturation}: The code bounds the output signal according to user-specified maximum and minimum saturation values.
	\item \textbf{Accelerometer Center of Mass Offset}: The code can handle accelerometer placement other than the center of mass of the spacecraft.
	\item \textbf{IMU Misalignment}: The code can handle IMU placement in a frame with constant rotational offset from assumed IMU orientation.
	\item \textbf{Bias Random Walk Bounds}: The code bounds bias random walk per user-specified bounds.
	\item \textbf{Interface: Spacecraft States}: The code sends and receives spacecraft state information via the Basilisk messaging system.
	\item \textbf{Interface: Spacecraft Mass}: The code receives spacecraft mass information via the Basilisk messaging system.
