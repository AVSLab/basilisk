\section{Test Description and Success Criteria}

This test set's up an appropriate simulation by creating a Spice Object, which will write messages containing ephemerides. A ephemeris converter object is also created with the map between the message names. This test guarantees that the data is properly copied.

This test is located in {\tt SimCode/environment/ephemeris$\_$converter/$\_$UnitTest/test$\_$ephemerisconvert.py}. \par

\subsection{Validation success criteria }

The criteria for a successful testing of this module is driven by the correct copy of the spice messages. This is done simply by comparing the messages before the copy with the outcome of the copied message. The error tolerance is at $\epsilon =10^{-5}$ which corresponds to 12 significant digits. This gives a healthy margin from machine precision all the while getting all of the physical information from the ephemerides.
