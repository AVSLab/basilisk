\section{Model Description}

\subsection{Introduction}
The ephemeris converter module has the purpose of copying the spice sim messages into a flight software interface message. This allow flight software module to access planet ephemeris data.

\subsection{I/O}

The spice message, which is read in by the module, contains the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item J2000Current: the time of validity for the planet state
\item PositionVector : the true position of the planet for the time
    \item  VelocityVector[3]: the tue velocity of the planet for the time
    \item  J20002Pfix: the orientation matrix of planet-fixed relative to inertial
    \item  J20002Pfix\_dot: the derivative of the orientation matrix of planet-fixed relative to inertial
    \item  computeOrient: a flag indicating whether the reference should be computed
    \item  PlanetName
\end{itemize}

Only the position and velocity vectors are transferred to the output ephemeris message, which therefore contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item r\_BdyZero\_N[3]: the position of orbital body in the inertial frame
    \item v\_BdyZero\_N[3]: the velocity of orbital body in the inertial frame
    \item timeTag: the vehicle Time-tag for state
\end{itemize}
