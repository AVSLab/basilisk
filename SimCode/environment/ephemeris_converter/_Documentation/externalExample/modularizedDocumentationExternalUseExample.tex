%This example shows how to load sections that are written elsewhere and look for their inputs in their own relative file path, rather than look from the document you are building.
%Here, the sec_header.tex file has \usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.
