\section{Test Parameters}

A spice object was created in order to write the messages that need to be copied.
The spice object was set on the following date: 2015 February 10, 00:00:00.0 TDB, and the planets that were loaded where the Earth, Mars Barycenter, and the Sun.

\subsubsection*{Successful link test}

A boolean variable is added for logging and is verified to have successfully linked the desired messages. This is done by comparing the variables down to $\epsilon =10^{-12}$, since we are looking for a value of 1.

\subsubsection*{Successful copy test}

For each of the celestial bodies who get a message output, we log the two messages that contain their position and velocities in the inertial frames. For mars the first message is the Spice message is $\texttt{mars$\_$planet$\_$data}$
and the second message is the ephemeris converted data $\texttt{mars$\_$ephemeris$\_$data}$. If the norm of their relative difference (including the time component of the vector), at any time, is greater than our error tolerance $\epsilon =10^{-12}$, then the test fails.
