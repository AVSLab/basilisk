             for use in HWM wind model)

dphi     = geocentric latitude increment (degrees, Northward positive)
dthet    = longitude increment (degrees, Eastward positive)
dhgt     = height increment (km, upward positive). If radius input is used,
             dhgt is interpreted as a radius increment.
nmax     = maximum number of positions (including initial one; 0 means read
             trajectory input file)
delt     = time increment between positions (real seconds)
iopt     = trajectory option (0 = no trajectory data; > 0 for trajectory data)
iaux     = auxiliary profile option (0 = no auxiliary profile; > 0 for auxiliary profile data) 
iprt	 = "output.txt" output option (0 = no "output.txt" output; > 0 = "output.txt" output)
inpr 	 = "special.txt" output option (0 = no "special.txt" output; > 0 = "special.txt" output)
icon 	 = "species.txt" output option (0 = no "species.txt" output; > 0 = "species.txt" output)
NCEPyr   = y1y2  to use NCEP climatology for period-of-record (POR) from year 
             y1 through year y2 (e.g. NCEPyr=9008 for POR = 1990 through 
             2008). NCEP monthly climatology is determined by input value 
             of month (mn) in initial time input
NCEPhr   = Code for UT hour of day if NCEP climatology is used: 1=00 UT, 
             2=06UT, 3=12UT, 4=18UT, 5=all times of day combined, or 0 to 
             use NCEP time-of-day based on input UTC hour (ihro)
nr1      = first starting random number (1 to 9 * 10**8)
mc     = number of Monte Carlo runs

sitelim  = lat-lon radius (deg) from RRA site, outside which RRA data are
             NOT used.  Also used, with a similar meaning, for auxiliary
             profile input.  Note that RRA and auxiliary profile input
             cannot be used simultaneously.
sitenear = lat-lon radius (deg) from RRA site, inside which RRA data is
             used with full weight of 1 (smooth transition of weight factor
             from 1 to 0 between sitenear and sitelim). Also used, with a 
             similar meaning, for auxiliary profile input.
initpert = Use 1 for user-selected initial perturbations or 0 (default) for
             GRAM-derived, random initial perturbation values
rdinit   = initial density perturbation value (% of mean)
rtinit   = initial temperature perturbation value (% of mean). Note - initial
             pressure perturbation is computed from rdinit and rtinit
ruinit   = initial eastward velocity perturbation (m/s)
rvinit   = initial northward velocity perturbation (m/s)
rwinit   = initial upward velocity perturbation (m/s)
patchy   = not equal 0 for patchiness; 0 to suppress patchiness in

            see file README7.txt.
ibltest  = unit number for BL model output file (bltest.txt), or 0 for no  
            BL model output
