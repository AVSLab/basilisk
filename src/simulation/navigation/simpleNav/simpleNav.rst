Simple navigation model used to provide error-ed truth (or truth). This class is used to perturb the truth state away using a gauss-markov
error model.  It is designed to look like a random walk process put on top of
the nominal position, velocity, attitude, and attitude rate.  This is meant to
be used in place of the nominal navigation system output.
