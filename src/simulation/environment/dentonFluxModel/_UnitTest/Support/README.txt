To generate the true flux values for the unitTest, unzip the 'DentonModelFortran.zip' file. The Fortran code is by M. H. Denton and can be downloaded from https://gemelli.spacescience.org/mdenton/. The 'Makefile' might have to be changed to be compatible with your computer. The Matlab code was created for this unitTest to automate the Fortran module. 

Copy the flux data files from 'basilisk/supportData/DentonGEO' into the './DentonModelFortran/data' directory ('data' folder needs to be created). Then, run the 'RunDenton.m' Matlab script for your desired Kp indices, local times and particle energies. This modifies the 'flux_model.f' file (using 'flux_model0.f'), builds the Fortran module, computes the electron and ion flux for the given inputs, and saves the results in text files.
