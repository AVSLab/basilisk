\section{Module Functions}
This module will:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Compute atmospheric density and temperature}: Each of the provided models is fundamentally intended to compute the neutral atmospheric density and temperature for a spacecraft relative to a body. These parameters are stored in the AtmoPropsSimMsg struct. Supporting parameters needed by each model, such as planet-relative position, are also computed.
	\item \textbf{Communicate neutral density and temperature}: This module interfaces with modules that subscribe to neutral density messages via the messaging system.
	\item \textbf {Subscribe to model-relevant information:} Each provided atmospheric model requires different input information to operate, such as current space weather conditions and spacecraft positions. This module automatically attempts to subscribe to the relevant messages for a specified model. 
	\item \textbf{Support for multiple spacecraft and model types} Only one Atmosphere module is required for each planet, and can support an arbitrary number of spacecraft. Output messages for individual spacecraft are automatically named based on the environment type.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
Individual atmospheric models are complex and have their own assumptions. For details about tradeoffs in atmospheric modeling, the reader is pointed to ~\citenum{vallado2013}.
