General magnetic field base class used to calculate the magnetic field above a planet using multiple models. The MagneticField class is used to calculate the magnetic field vector above a body using multiple models. This base class is used to hold relevant planetary magnetic field properties to compute answers for a given set of spacecraft locations relative to a specified planet.  Specific magnetic field models are implemented as classes that inherit from this base class. Planetary parameters, including position and input message, are settable by the user. In a given simulation, each planet of interest should have only one magnetic field  model associated with it linked to the spacecraft in orbit about that body.
