\section{Model Description}

The purpose of this module is to wrap the Brodowski implementation of the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric neutral density model\footnote{\url{https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/modelinfo.php?model=MSISE}} for use with other Basilisk modules. NRLMSISE-00 is a high-fidelity, empirically-derived model of the Earth's atmosphere that considers the effects of common space phenomena (magnetic/solar influences) on neutral atmospheric density. A portfolio of individual models is valid up to 1000km, and provides both the neutral temperature and species in addition to the total mass density.
