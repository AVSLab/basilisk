\section{Model Description}

The purpose of this module is to implement neutral atmospheric density and temperature models.
Atmosphere represents a single interface to a variety of atmospheric models within the BSK framework. These are briefly summarized here for reference.


\subsection{Exponential Atmosphere}
Under the assumption of an isothermal atmosphere, an expression for atmospheric density can be readily arrived at by combining the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium with the ideal gas law and integrating, yielding:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expAtmo}
\rho = \rho_0 e^{\frac{-h}{h_0}}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0$ is the density at the planet's surface, $h$ is the altitude, and $h_0$ is the atmospheric scale height derived from the weighted-average behavior of the species that make up the atmosphere. A list of these parameters
for atmospheric bodies in the solar system is available from NASA \href{https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html}{here}. For more detail, see Reference ~\citenum{vallado2013}. 

\subsection{NRLMSISE-00}
NRLMSISE-00 is an empircally derived neutral density and temperature model maintained by the Naval Research Laboratory. Basilisk uses the \href{https://www.brodo.de/space/nrlmsise/index.html}{C implementation of NRLMSISE-00} published by Dr. Dominik Brodowski.

At present, this functionality is not implemented.
