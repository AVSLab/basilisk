/* All of the files in this folder (architecture/messaging2/cMsgCInterface) are autocoded by the script
architecture/messaging2/cMsgTemplate/GenCMessages.py.
The script checks for the line "INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES" in the file architecture/messaging/message.i. This
ensures that if a c++ message is instantiated that we also have a C equivalent of that message.

If you need to edit the way that these types/functions are written,
edit the templates in architecture/messaging/cMessageTemplate and run GenCMessages.py.
