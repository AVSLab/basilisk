/* All of the files in this folder (c_messages) are autocoded by the script GenCMessages.py.
The script checks for the line "INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES" in the file message.i. This
ensures that if a c++ message is instantiated that we also have a C equivalent of that message.

If you need to edit the way that these types/functions are written,
edit the templates in /templates and run GenCMessages.py.
