\section{Model Functions}
The functions of the voltage to torque model are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Voltage to Torque}: Converts given voltage to a torque command.
\end{itemize}


\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
This code makes assumptions which are common to IMU modeling.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{No noise}: There is no random noise input when making the voltage to torque conversion.
	\item \textbf{All wheels the same}: All reaction wheels utilize the same gain, scale factor, and bias. No wheel can be singled out to have higher scale factor or bias, etc.

\end{itemize}
