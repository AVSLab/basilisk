\section{Model Description}

\section{Introduction}
The Thruster model in the AVS Basilisk simulation is used to emulate the effect
of a vehicle's thrusters on the overall system.  Its primary use is to generate
realistic forces/torques on the vehicle structure and body.  This is
accomplished by applying a force at a specified location/direction in the body and
using the current vehicle center of mass to calculate the resultant torque.
Each individual thruster in a given model has its own ramp-up/ramp-down profile
specified as part of its initialization data and it follows those profiles during
start-up and shutdown.

The thruster model also contains a mechanism that is used to change the current
vehicle mass properties as the thruster fires propellant overboard.  This model
uses the thruster ISP (specific impulse, also specified with configuration data)
to calculate how much mass is being removed during a given thruster firing and
decrements the mass properties included in the thruster linearly as a function
of mass.

With a fuel tank connected, fuel mass information also flows back to the thruster.
This mass of the fuel can be used to scale the available thrust and $I_{sp}$ as a tank
depletes, modeling the blow down effects of pressure loss.

\subsection{Output}

This module computes forces and torques, and is called as a Dynamic Effector to integrate the state.
