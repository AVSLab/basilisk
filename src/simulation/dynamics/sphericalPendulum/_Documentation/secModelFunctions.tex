\section{Model Functions}

This module is intended to be used as a oscillating spherical pendulum attached to the spacecraft. Below is a list of functions that this model performs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute it's contributions to the mass properties of the spacecraft
	\item Provides matrix contributions for the back substitution method
	\item Compute it's derivatives
	\item Adds energy and momentum contributions to the spacecraft
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
Below is a summary of the assumptions/limitations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The mass is assumed to be concentrated at the pendulum meaning that the mass is considered a point mass
	\item The link is considered massless: the link being the length between the rotation point and the mass 
	\item Is derived in such a manner that does not require constraints to be met
\end{itemize}
