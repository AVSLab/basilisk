\section{User Guide}

This section is to outline the steps needed to setup a reaction wheel state effector in python using Basilisk.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Import the reactionWheelStateEffector class, the spacecraftPlus class, and the simIncludeRW python module: \newline \textit{import reactionWheelStateEffector}, \textit{import spacecraftPlus} and \textit{import simIncludeRW}
	\item Define an instantiation of a rwFactory: \newline
	\textit{rwFactory = simIncludeRW.rwFactory()}
	\item Create a reaction wheel (Honeywell HR16 as an example): \newline 
	\textit{rwFactory.create()} \newline
		\textit{'Honeywell\_HR16'} \newline
		\textit{,[1,0,0]} \newline
		\textit{,Omega = 500.} \newline
		\textit{,rWB\_B = [0.1,0.,0.]} \newline
		\textit{,maxMomentum = varMaxMomentum} \newline
		\textit{,RWModel= varRWModel})
	\item To include stribeck friction effects, include \textit{ betaStatic } within the rwFactory.create() and assign it a non-zero value. By default, betaStatic is set to -1 and stribeck friction is ignored. 
	\item Create an instantiation of a reaction wheel state effector: \newline \textit{rws = reactionWheelStateEffector.ReactionWheelStateEffector()}
	\item Create an instantiation of a spacecraftPlus: \newline
	\textit{scObject = spacecraftPlus.SpacecraftPlus()}
	\item Finally, add the reaction wheel object to your spacecraftPlus:\newline
	\textit{rwFactory.addToSpacecraft("ReactionWheels", rwStateEffector, scObject)}. See spacecraftPlus documentation on how to set up a spacecraftPlus object. 
\end{enumerate}
