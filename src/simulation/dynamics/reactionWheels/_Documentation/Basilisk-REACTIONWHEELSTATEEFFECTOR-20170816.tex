% README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.
% This template should be used to document all Basilisk modules.

%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
% All edits should be made in one of:
% sec_modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
% sec_modelDescription.tex
% sec_modelFunctions.tex
% sec_revisionTable.tex
% sec_testDescription.tex
% sec_testParameters.tex
% sec_testResults.tex
% sec_user_guide.tex
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the user guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{The reaction wheel class is an instantiation of the state effector abstract class. The integrated test is validating the interaction between the reaction wheel module and the rigid body hub that it is attached to. More specifically, the reaction wheel module models three different cases: balanced wheels, simpled jitter, and fully coupled jitter. The details of each mode is described in detail in this document. There are integrated tests that confirm that all three models are agreeing with physics and the tests use both energy and momentum checks and back of the envelope (BOE) calculations. There are also unit tests verifying other functionality of the module}
