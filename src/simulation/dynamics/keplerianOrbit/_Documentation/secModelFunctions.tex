\section{Model Functions}
This module contains several functionalities described below

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Interface: Orbit Elements}
	Classic Orbit elements are provided to define the orbit. Individual elements can be changed.
	\item \textbf{Interface: Outputs}
	Classic orbital properties like angular momenum and enegy can be access as functions using variable names common in such tests as Vallado. For example, specific orbital angular momentum is access via the member method \verb|h()|.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Limitation: Elliptical Orbits} In its current incarnation, this module supports only elliptical orbits. Future work should expand the class to include parabolic, hyperbolic, and circular orbits.
\end{itemize}
