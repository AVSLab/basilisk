\section{User Guide}
This module was meticulously set up to ensure that all variables can only be set or retrieved by setter and getter functions. If the module is instantiated without arguments, the spacecraft is in some arbitrary orbit. Generally, it should be called with the first argument as the desired orbital elements and the second argument as a GravBodyData object.
