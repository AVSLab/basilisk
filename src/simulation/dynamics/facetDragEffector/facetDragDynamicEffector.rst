Drag dynamics class used to compute drag effects on spacecraft bodies

This class is used to implement drag dynamic effects on spacecraft using a variety of simple or complex models, which will include
cannonball (attitude-independent) drag, single flat-plate drag, faceted drag models, and an interface to full-CAD GPU-accellerated
drag models.
