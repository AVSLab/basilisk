/*
Each DynamicObject has a series of states associated to them. Each state
is associated with a unique std::string (i.e. "hubPosition"), and their
value is stored as Eigen::MatrixXd. Each of these states is integrated
in parallel: each have their own derivative, which are all calculated
in DynamicObject::equationsOfMotion.

Basilisk also supports the parallel integration of multiple DynamicObjects,
which in practice means that all states of all DynamicObjects need to
be integrated in parallel.

In order to facilitate this task, the ExtendedStateVector was created.
This class is a map that can hold an Eigen::MatrixXd for every state
of every DynamicObject that we want to integrate. Thus, it can be
used to store the value of the states, their derivatives, errors...
in a single, flat object. This is similar to the behaviour of StateVector,
except that this supports multiple DynamicObjects.

ExtendedStateVector supports a series of utility functions that
makes performing state-wise operations easier.
