Executive Summary
-----------------

This class is an instantiation of the stateEffector class and is a `N`-hinged rigid body effector. This effector is a rigid body attached to the hub through a torsional spring and damper that approximates a flexible appendage. See Allard, Schaub, and Piggott paper: `General Hinged Solar Panel Dynamics Approximating First-Order Spacecraft Flexing <http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/1.A34125>`__ for a detailed description of this model. A hinged rigid body has 2 states: theta and thetaDot
