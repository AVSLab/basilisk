% README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.
% This template should be used to document all Basilisk modules.

%
%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
% All edits should be made in one of:
% sec_modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
% sec_modelDescription.tex
% sec_modelFunctions.tex
% sec_revisionTable.tex
% sec_testDescription.tex
% sec_testParameters.tex
% sec_testResults.tex
% sec_user_guide.tex
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the suer guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{SpacecraftSystem is an instantiation of the dynamicObject abstract class. This abstract class is representing systems that have equations of motion that need to be integrated and therefore the main goal of this dynamic object is finding the state derivatives and interfacing with the integrator to integrate the state forward in time. The spacecraftSystem is specifically geared towards simulating multiple spacecraft at a time that will allow for docking and detaching of spacecraft. If spacecraft is ever removed then this will be the sole dynamicObject that will control the spacecraft dynamics of the system. This current module is IN PROGRESS and burning edge development in its current state.}
