% README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.

%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
% All edits should be made in one of:
% sec_modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
% sec_modelDescription.tex
% sec_modelFunctions.tex
% sec_revisionTable.tex
% sec_testDescription.tex
% sec_testParameters.tex
% sec_testResults.tex
% sec_user_guide.tex
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the suer guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{FuelTank is an instantiation of the stateEffector abstract class. The abstract class is for effectors who have states that need to be integrated and can be coupled the dynamics of the spacecraft hub. The fuelTank specifically is modeling the depleting the fuel tank mass and can have a dynamical effect with the hub based on its changing mass properties with respect to mass leaving the spacecraft through thrusters. This document outlines the analytical development of the model, the assumptions being made, and the tests that are being computed to validate/verify the model.}
