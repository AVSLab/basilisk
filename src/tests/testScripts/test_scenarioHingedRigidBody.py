#
# Basilisk Scenario Script and Integrated Test
#
# Purpose:  Integrated tutorial of the spacecraftPlus(), gravity, and hinged rigid body modules illustrating
#           how Delta_v maneuver from test_scenarioOrbitManeuver.py affects the motion of the hinged rigid bodies.
#           Rotational motion is allowed on the spacecraft to simulate the full interaction of the hinged rigid
#           bodies and the spacecraft.
# Author:   Scott Carnahan
