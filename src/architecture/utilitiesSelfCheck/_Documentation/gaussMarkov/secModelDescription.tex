\section{Model Description}

This utility produces white noise. It can have a bias added to it to make a non-zero mean. It also generates "random walk" by treating the noise as additive. Walk bounds can be provided that push the random walk away from the boundary. Setting the bounds to zero or less disables the random walk, this is the default.
