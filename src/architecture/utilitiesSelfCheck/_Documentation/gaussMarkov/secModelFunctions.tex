\section{Model Functions}
The Gauss Markov functions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Set seed}: Sets the random number generator seed.
	\item \textbf{Compute next state}: Computes the next state using the propagation and noise matrices taking walk bounds into account
	\item \textbf{Get current state}: Retrieves the noise calculated to add to a state.
	\item \textbf{Set noise matrix}: Sets the noise covariance matrix
	\item \textbf{Set propagation matrix}: Sets the matrix by which to propagate noise.
	\item \textbf{Set bounds}: Sets the random walk bounds symmetric about 0.
\end{itemize}


\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Walk Bounds}: It is assumed that the user sets appropriate walk bounds.
\end{itemize}
