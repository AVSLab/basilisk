\section{Model Description}

The purpose of this module is to read in the IMU sensor body message from message type {\tt IMUSensorBodyFswMsg}, and store it in the output message of type {\tt NavAttIntMsg}.  The body rate vector is stored in the variable {\tt AngVelBody} of the incoming message.  The output message of type {\tt NavAttIntMsg} is used as a common attitude input message by the FSW modules.  This output message is first zeroed, and then the rate vector is copied into the variable {\tt omega\_BN\_B}.
