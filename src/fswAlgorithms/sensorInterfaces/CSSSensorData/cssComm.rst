This module is responsible for correcting the raw CSS output values to the expected cosine values. This requires a pre-calibrated Chebyshev residual model which calculates the expected deviation from the expected CSS cosine output given a raw CSS measurement at a given distance from the sun. More information on can be found in the
:download:`PDF Description </../../src/fswAlgorithms/sensorInterfaces/CSSSensorData/_Documentation/Basilisk-CSSSensorDataModule-20190207.pdf>`.
