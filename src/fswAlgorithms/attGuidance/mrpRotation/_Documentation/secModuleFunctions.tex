\section{Module Functions}
The {\tt mrpRotation} module has the following design goals
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Constant Spin}: The angular velocity vector between the input and output frame is constant as see by output reference frame
	\item \textbf{MPR attitude representation}: The initial and output attitude is described through an MRP coordinate set
	\item \textbf{Flexible Setup}:  The desired rotation state can be described through an initial MRP and angular velocity vector specified in module internal variables, or read in through a Basilisk {\tt AttStateFswMsg} message.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item On reset the the next time step doesn't yield an integration as the integration time evaluation requires at least a second time step.
	\item If the desired rotation states are read in with an input message, on reset these values are re-read in again.
	\item If the desired rotation is specified with module internal states, then on reset the prior internal states are re-used unless they are over-written after the reset call.
\end{itemize}
