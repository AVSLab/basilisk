\section{Module Functions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Read ST Messages: } Read in the messages from all available star trackers and orders them with respect to time of measurement
    \item \textbf{InertialUKFAggGyrData: } Aggregate the input gyro data into a combined total quaternion 
    rotation to push the state forward.  This information is stored in the 
    main data structure for use in the propagation routines.
\end{itemize}
