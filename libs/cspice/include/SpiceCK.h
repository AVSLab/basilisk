         SpiceCK05Subtype      Typedef for enum indicating the 
                               mathematical representation used
                               in an CK type 05 segment.  Possible
                               values and meanings are:

                               C05TP0:

                                  element packets containing 
                                  
                                     q0,      q1,      q2,     q3, 
                                     dq0/dt,  dq1/dt,  dq2/dt  dq3/dt
                   
                                  where q0, q1, q2, q3 represent 
                                  quaternion components and dq0/dt, 
                                  dq1/dt, dq2/dt, dq3/dt represent 
                                  quaternion time derivative components.  
 
                                  Quaternions are unitless.  Quaternion
                                  time derivatives have units of 
                                  1/second.


                               C05TP1:
  
                                  Lagrange interpolation, 4-

                                     q0,     q1,     q2,     q3, 
 
                                  where q0, q1, q2, q3 represent 
                                  quaternion components.  Quaternion
                                  derivatives are obtained by
                                  differentiating interpolating
                                  polynomials.

                                     dav0/dt, dav1/dt, dav2/dt
                   
                                  where q0, q1, q2, q3 represent 
                                  quaternion components and dq0/dt, 
                                  dq1/dt, dq2/dt, dq3/dt represent 
                                  quaternion time derivative components,
                                  av0, av1, av2 represent angular
                                  velocity components, and 
                                  dav0/dt, dav1/dt, dav2/dt represent 
                                  angular acceleration components.
 

                               C05TP3:
  
                                  Lagrange interpolation, 7-
                                  element packets containing 

                                     q0,     q1,     q2,     q3, 
                                     av0,    av1,    av2
 
                                  where q0, q1, q2, q3 represent 
                                  quaternion components and         
                                  av0, av1, av2 represent angular
