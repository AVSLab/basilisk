-Particulars
 
   This header file defines macros that enable CSPICE code to be
   compiled conditionally based on the identity of the host platform.
 
   The macros defined here ARE visible in the macro name space of
   any file that includes SpiceUsr.h.  The names are prefixed with
   the string CSPICE_ to help prevent conflicts with macros defined
   by users' applications.
