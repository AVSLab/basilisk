-Particulars

   The routines maintain a count of the number of mallocs vs. free, 
   signalling an error if any unreleased memory exists at the end 
   of an Icy interface call.

   The macro ALLOC_CHECK performs malloc/free test. If used, the macro 
   should exists at the end of any routine using these memory management
   routines.

      alloc_count

-Version

   CSPICE 1.0.3 02-MAY-2008 (EDW)

      Added alloc_count prototype.

   CSPICE 1.0.2 10-MAY-2007 (EDW)

      Minor edits to clarify 'size' in alloc_SpiceMemory as 
      size_t.

   CSPICE 1.0.1 23-JUN-2005 (EDW)

      Add prototype for alloc_SpiceString_Pointer_array, allocate
      an array of pointers to SpiceChar.

   Icy 1.0.0 December 19, 2003 (EDW)
   
      Initial release.
