   Macros
   ======
   
      Workspace parameters
      --------------------
 
      CSPICE applications normally don't declare workspace arguments
      and therefore don't directly reference workspace size parameters.
      However, CSPICE GF APIs dealing with numeric constraints
      dynamically allocate workspace memory; the amount allocated
      depends on the number of intervals the workspace windows can
      hold. This amount is an input argument to the GF numeric quantity
      APIs.
 
      The parameters below are used to calculate the amount of memory
      required. Each workspace window contains 6 double precision
      numbers in its control area and 2 double precision numbers for
      each interval it can hold.

      
         Name                  Description
         ----                  ----------
         SPICE_GF_NWMAX        Maximum number of windows required for 
                               a user-defined workspace array. 
         
         SPICE_GF_NWDIST       Number of workspace windows used by
                               gfdist_c and the underlying SPICELIB

         SPICE_GF_NWILUM       Number of workspace windows used by
                               gfilum_c and the underlying SPICELIB
                               routine GFILUM.

         SPICE_GF_NWSEP        Number of workspace windows used by

                               routine GFRR.
                               
         SPICE_GF_NWPA         Number of workspace windows used by
                               gfpa_c and the underlying SPICELIB

      Field of view (FOV) parameters
      ------------------------------

         Name                  Description
         ----                  ----------
         SPICE_GF_MAXVRT       Maximum allowed number of boundary
                               vectors for a polygonal FOV.
         
         SPICE_GF_CIRFOV       Parameter identifying a circular FOV.

         SPICE_GF_ELLFOV       Parameter identifying a elliptical FOV.

         SPICE_GF_POLFOV       Parameter identifying a polygonal FOV.

         SPICE_GF_RECFOV       Parameter identifying a rectangular FOV.

         SPICE_GF_SHPLEN       Parameter specifying maximum length of
                               a FOV shape name.

         SPICE_GF_MARGIN       is a small positive number used to
                               constrain the orientation of the
                               boundary vectors of polygonal FOVs. Such
                               FOVs must satisfy the following
                               constraints:

                               1)  The boundary vectors must be
                                   contained within a right circular
                                   cone of angular radius less than
                                   than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in
                                   other words, there must be a vector
                                   A such that all boundary vectors
                                   have angular separation from A of
                                   less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.
 
                               2)  There must be a pair of boundary
                                   vectors U, V such that all other
                                   boundary vectors lie in the same
                                   half space bounded by the plane
                                   containing U and V. Furthermore, all
                                   other boundary vectors must have
                                   orthogonal projections onto a plane
                                   normal to this plane such that the
                                   projections have angular separation
                                   of at least 2*MARGIN radians from
                                   the plane spanned by U and V.

                               MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-12.
         

      Occultation parameters
      ----------------------

         SPICE_GF_ANNULR       Parameter identifying an "annular
                               occultation." This geometric condition
                               is more commonly known as a "transit."
                               The limb of the background object must
                               not be blocked by the foreground object
                               in order for an occultation to be
                               "annular."

         SPICE_GF_ANY          Parameter identifying any type of
                               occultation or transit.

         SPICE_GF_FULL         Parameter identifying a full
                               occultation: the foreground body
                               entirely blocks the background body.

         SPICE_GF_PARTL        Parameter identifying an "partial
                               occultation." This is an occultation in
                               which the foreground body blocks part,
                               but not all, of the limb of the
                               background body.

 

      Target shape parameters
      -----------------------

         SPICE_GF_EDSHAP       Parameter indicating a target object's
                               shape is modeled as an ellipsoid.

         SPICE_GF_PTSHAP       Parameter indicating a target object's
                               shape is modeled as a point.

         SPICE_GF_RYSHAP       Parameter indicating a target object's
                               "shape" is modeled as a ray emanating
                               from an observer's location. This model
                               may be used in visibility computations
                               for targets whose direction, but not
                               position, relative to an observer is
                               known.
 
         SPICE_GF_SPSHAP       Parameter indicating a target object's
                               shape is modeled as a point.



      Search parameters
      -----------------

      These parameters affect the manner in which GF searches are
      performed. 

         SPICE_GF_ADDWIN       is a parameter used in numeric quantity
                               searches that use an equality
                               constraint. This parameter is used to
                               expand the confinement window (the
                               window over which the search is
                               performed) by a small amount at both
                               ends. This expansion accommodates the
                               case where a geometric quantity is equal
                               to a reference value at a boundary point
                               of the original confinement window.
 
         SPICE_GF_CNVTOL       is the default convergence tolerance
                               used by GF routines that don't support a
                               user-supplied tolerance value. GF
                               searches for roots will terminate when a
                               root is bracketed by times separated by
                               no more than this tolerance. Units are
                               seconds.

      Configuration parameter
      -----------------------

         SPICE_GFEVNT_MAXPAR   Parameter indicating the maximum number of 
                               elements needed for the 'qnames' and 'q*pars'
                               arrays used in gfevnt_c.

                               SpiceChar    qcpars[SPICE_GFEVNT_MAXPAR][LNSIZE];
                               SpiceDouble  qdpars[SPICE_GFEVNT_MAXPAR];
                               SpiceInt     qipars[SPICE_GFEVNT_MAXPAR];
                               SpiceBoolean qlpars[SPICE_GFEVNT_MAXPAR];
