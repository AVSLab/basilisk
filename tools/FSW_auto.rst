## autosetter directory
- Purpose: automatically translate the setup code from Python scenarios into C. Setup code encompasses: 1) C modules' variables initialization and 2) Grouping of modules in tasks

- Output: one header and source file containing the setup code written in C will be created in a fresh local directory named "sets/"


## autowrapper directory
- Purpose: create C++ classes with setters and getters around each C module. Currently
- Instructions: run the "auto_wrapper.py" file that lives inside the "autowrapper/" directory
