<p><strong>Version 2.3.0 (July 11, 2025)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">terminateVizard</span></code> to Vizard Live Settings to allow for clean shut-down
of Vizard from live Basilisk simulation</p></li>
<li><p>Can terminate scenario by setting the flag, then calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viz.UpdateState()</span></code> once
to send to Vizard. This last message will not save to the binary. Example is shown
in <a class="reference internal" href="../examples/scenarioBasicOrbitStream.html#scenariobasicorbitstream"><span class="std std-ref">scenarioBasicOrbitStream</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added dimension descriptions for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bskSat</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3USat</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6USat</span></code> satellites</p></li>
<li><p>Changed name of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">customGUIScale</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">customGUIReferenceHeight</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Deprecated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">customGUIScale</span></code>. Using this setting name has no effect but throws an
error and points to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">customGUIReferenceHeight</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an explicit creation of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizInterface.VizSettings()</span></code> structure
inside <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizSupport.enableUnityVisualization()</span></code>. This was necessary to
kickstart the deprecation warnings.</p></li>
<li><p>Support and documentation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spacecraftOrbitLineWidth</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">celestialBodyOrbitLineWidth</span></code></p></li>

<li><p>changed all GUI Text elements to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TextMeshPro</span></code> text elements</p></li>
<li><p>changed GUI Canvas scaling to scale up GUI elements (buttons, text, etc.) as a
function of screen height to better support very large displays</p></li>
<li><p>added Unity Line Renderers to osculating orbit lines and true path trajectory
lines to allow better visibility on large displays</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>user can toggle off Line Renderers in the Settings menu</p></li>
<li><p>user can increase or decrease the pixel width of the Line Renderer
lines in the Settings menu or with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpacecraftOrbitLineWidth</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CelestialBodyOrbitLineWidth</span></code> message settings</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">showHUDElementsInImage</span></code> flag to both Instrument Cameras and Standard
cameras to allow users to toggle ability to see HUD elements in images
(i.e. Coarse Sun Sensor coverage, multi-shapes, etc). Standard camera panel
includes toggle to show or hide HUD elements in view</p></li>
<li><p>changed line elements in HUD elements (camera frustums, boresight lines)
from OpenGL to Unity LineRenderers so they can be hidden from secondary
cameras if desired (OpenGL lines were always visible)</p></li>
<li><p>Sprite mode is implemented on Keep Out/In Cones (cones will hide when
spacecraft is in sprite-mode)</p></li>
<li><p>removed obsolete work-around for secondary camera rendering issue that
popped user out of maximized screen when loading Vizard Main Scene</p></li>
<li><p>fixed issue with spacecraft not showing itself as shadowed by planet
when outside of the Main Camera’s shadow calculation threshold</p></li>
<li><p>fixed image jitter in Standard Camera when pointed nadir at another spacecraft</p></li>
<li><p>refactored error messaging when models fail to load to remove duplicate
error messages and automatically pop up console panel to alert user</p></li>
<li><p>fixed Location label visibility raycasting bug. Location labels not in line of
sight will now be hidden (correctly)</p></li>
<li><p>updated documenation that the light weight location markers cannot use opaque colors.
This caused a drastic increase in CPU load.</p></li>
<li><p>added ability for location marker to be hidden via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isHidden</span></code> flag</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.2.3 (April 20, 2025)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added QuadMap sub message to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VizMessage.proto</span></code>, allows user to draw a mesh
of quads on celestial body or spacecraft</p></li>
<li><p>Added logging of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QuadMap</span></code> sub message in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VizMessage</span></code> panel</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for turning all <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QuadMap</span></code> object labels on or off from Labels panel</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug with effectors not hiding when parent spacecraft is in sprite mode in
planet local or solar system view</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.2.2 (March 7, 2025)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Migrated to Unity 6</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TargetLines</span></code> can target <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LocationMarkers</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Improved support for scenarios with Locations in the thousands</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for scaling of Location markers, size can be increased or
decreased from Vizard default dynamically per Location</p></li>
<li><p>MSM Heads Up Display - added support for other primitive shapes
(cube, cylinder, capsule, as well as original sphere) which required adding
sub-message fields for Shape, Dimensions, and Rotation of each MSM</p></li>
<li><p>Added effectors visibility at planet scale and solar system scale
(effectors correctly scaled and offset relative to parent spacecraft)</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for “CAPSULE” primitive shape when importing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CustomModel</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: if a normal map texture is imported when generating a custom material,
the normal map is enabled in the shader</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: if imported model has multiple meshes, apply custom material to all meshes in model</p></li>
<li><p>Added input field to AdjustModel panel to control normal map height</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: when using buffered playback, chief spacecraft Hill or Velocity matrices
are now automatically recalculated after buffer rollover</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: if camera target is a spacecraft on start-up and the settings flag
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpacecraftCSon</span></code> is set to 1, the spacecraft coordinate system will be shown and the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cameraTarget</span></code> CS on toggle will be on under the View Menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for relative paths for importing custom models and textures
(their paths should be relative to the location of the playback .bin file or
the directory the scenario is being executed from, if showing a live simulation)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.2.1 (January 13, 2025)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support for loading .glb model files at runtime using the Import Model GUI Panel or using the custom model import VizMessage</p></li>
<li><p>Added ability to plot each spacecraft’s true path trajectory relative to a parent body (default), another body selected by user, or relative to the origin of the inertial frame (old default), user can select how to plot the true path trajectory with an option button in the View menu</p></li>
<li><p>Added ability to visualize true path trajectory in a two-body rotating frame, user can select which two celestial bodies make up the rotating frame under the View menu</p></li>
<li><p>Added ability to plot each spacecraft’s true path trajectory in a selected spacecraft or celestial body’s fixed frame</p></li>
<li><p>Revised True Path Trajectory settings and organization under View Menu to improve use and support added trajectory view settings</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the new True Path Trajectory view settings to VizMessage settings</p></li>
<li><p>Added “Open Scenario File” button to File Menu to allow user to load a different playback file without quitting Vizard</p></li>

<li><p>Bug fix: protected against bad raycast call while loading obj at start that would cause app to freeze</p></li>
<li><p>Added addressables for IceSat and Kepler satellites</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.2.0 (August 20, 2024)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added VizEventDialog message type to VizMessage.proto. EventDialogs allow the user to create a GUI
panel that pops up in Vizard with informational text and optional button choices that the viewer
can select to provide input to the simulation (via a VizEventReply message). There are three dialog
format types: informational, caution (yellow), and warning (red).</p></li>
<li><p>Added ability to send keyboard and EventDialog selection inputs live to connected Basilisk simulation,
via the new VizInput message in VizMessage.proto,  this feature requires Vizard to be connected to
Basilisk in the Receive &amp; Reply mode</p></li>
<li><p>Added Receive Only streaming mode to allow additional Vizard instances to subscribe to a Basilisk
simulation as viewers. Receive Only connections cannot provide input back to the Basilisk simulation</p></li>
<li><p>Added forced synchronization of EventDialog and certain settings (orbit line visibility, coordinate
frame visibility) of Receive Only (broadcast) viewers with the Receive and Reply user (trainer).
When forced synchronization is enabled, broadcast Vizard instances will display the current choices
and settings selections of the trainer. The trainer can release forced synchronization mode under the
Broadcast tab of the Settings panel to allow broadcast viewers to control their own displays.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved Vizard handling of incorrect socket address or connection type: failure to connect will
result in error message and user will have a chance to correct socket address and/or connection type</p></li>
<li><p>Improved camera transition between scale regimes (spacecraft local view to planet local
view to hello view)</p></li>
<li><p>Improved camera transition on selection of new camera target</p></li>
<li><p>depth map shader output textures changed to red-channel only while multi-channel shader
issue is resolved</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>depth map shader color output values are being adjusted by Unity after being written by fragment shader,
resulting in incorrect depth measurements using the three-channel decoding</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizInterface.opNavMode</span></code> is now depreciated.  See <a class="reference internal" href="vizardAdvanced/vizardLiveComm.html#vizardlivecomm"><span class="std std-ref">Live Communication with Vizard</span></a> for more
information.  The setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opNavMode=1</span></code> is now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">liveStream</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opNavMode=2</span></code> is now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noDisplay</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Version 2.1.6.1 (March 20, 2024)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>force Vizard to show the most recently received message when a camera image request
is received in 2-way comm (this was not required in noDisplay mode because we stay on
the head of the received messages, but because we do not stay on the head when the
display is on we needed a way to make sure the images were taken of the correct timestep)</p></li>
<li><p>moved ASyncIO.ForceDotNet.Force() call to before sockets are created (solved a Windows
issue where 2-way comm was not completing handshake)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.1.6 (March 1, 2024)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Buffered loading of file playback messages (only 10 MB will be loaded into memory by default)
This value can be customized with the new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">messageBufferSize</span></code> setting</p></li>
<li><p>Migrated to Unity 2022.3 (Addressables built with Unity 2020 version are compatible with Unity
2022 Vizard and do not need to be rebuilt or replaced)</p></li>
<li><p>Added fall-back non-native file browser for Linux platform</p></li>
<li><p>Black Lion removed from startup screen options</p></li>
<li><p>time-out on socket connection attempt in start-up screen (if a vizMessage is not received
within 4 seconds, Vizard will try to close the open socket and the user can try again)</p></li>
<li><p>playback will be paused and playback controls will be hidden during model loading
(to prevent confusion during large model imports)</p></li>
<li><p>hot key “c” added to pop up Console Log panel</p></li>
<li><p>automatic pop up of Console Log for errors that need the user’s attention</p></li>
<li><p>hot key “v” added to pop up VizMessage panel</p></li>
<li><p>GenericStorage display will now show “Unavailable” when currentValue is less than 0 to
allow simulation of lost telemetry</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed playback speed displaying infinity on Windows</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug with thruster cone geometry not scaling appropriately when spacecraftLocalView
scale is changed and MaxThrust was not specified (occurs in some old LASP files)</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug in the sub-dropdowns (used when Effectors are present) when a Location’s properties are updated</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.1.5 (June 28, 2023)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>main camera range to target display (hot key = r, or toggle under Camera menu)</p></li>
<li><p>very far zoom-out of main camera in spacecraft local view when the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forceStartAtSpacecraftLocalView</span></code>
setting is set to 1</p></li>
<li><p>depth map generation available on instrument camera - can only be turned on in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CameraConfig</span></code> message</p></li>
<li><p>command line start of Vizard with file load (use argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-loadFile</span></code> followed by the filepath)</p></li>
<li><p>updated NetMQ plugins to be compatible with Basilisk ZMQ 3.5.0 libraries</p></li>
<li><p>fixed the cause of the effectors appearing to fly-in at start-up</p></li>
<li><p>support for nested toggles for effectors for all HUDS and devices under the Actuator and Devices menus</p></li>
<li><p>Add the ability to visualize ground locations using a simple colored sphere.  This allows 1000’s of locations

<li><p>support for changing the true path trajectory line color allowing a path line with multiple
colors that can be used to indicate phases of interest in the trajectory</p></li>
<li><p>added support for reflection probes on Custom spacecraft models imported via Addressables,
Vizard will detect any reflection probes included on the model and configure them to display
correctly with Vizard’s internal settings</p></li>
<li><p>added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">parentSpacecraftName</span></code> field to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VizMessage.proto</span></code> spacecraft message definition which
will allow the creation of effectors using the spacecraft message template. Providing a spacecraft
name in that field will indicate that the message belongs to an effector of that parent spacecraft.</p></li>
<li><p>added Vizard support for effectors including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not showing orbit lines for effectors</p></li>
<li><p>adding a coordinate system toggle for effectors</p></li>
<li><p>adding subdropdowns to the GUI to indicate which bodies are effectors and to reduce clutter
in the main body dropdown</p></li>
<li><p>added parent spacecraft name to effector name on any HUD or panel toggles to clarify effector parent</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>fixed bug in thruster and transceiver particle systems that did not correctly scale for small sats</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in hemisphere mesh generation (used by CSS and location range) that would result in
failure if the field of view was very small</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug where GenericSensor HUD was not correctly illuminated by the HUDShell lighting</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug where CSS would incorrectly turn on after exiting Sprite mode when they should have
stayed off due to current settings</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in orbitLine template that would sometimes throw an error when reference was accessed
before being set</p></li>
<li><p>migrated Vizard to Unity Editor 2020.3.45f1</p></li>
<li><p>removed auto creation of the two standard camera panels, now camera panels will only be generated
when requested by user in the GUI or in messages</p></li>
<li><p>added support for spacecraft where no spacecraft name was specified in Basilisk, user will see an
error message in the VizConsole Log panel and Vizard will automatically name the spacecraft and continue to run</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.1.3 (Jan. 20, 2023)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>added support for Settings flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forceStartAtSpacecraftLocalView</span></code>. If this flag is set to 1, the main camera will stay in the spacecraft local view and has been improved to allow zooming out to very large distances from the camera target spacecraft. Vizard will remain locked in spacecraft local view unless a non-spacecraft camera target is selected.</p></li>
<li><p>added MultiSphere support to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VizMessage.proto</span></code> and support visualizing the MultiSpheres on a spacecraft.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>fixed bug with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OBJ</span></code> imported models when applied to celestial body whose equatorial radius is set. Now if radius is set the model will be scaled such that largest dimension will equal the equatorial radius. If radius is not set, the model will be scaled to the settings specified by the user and then the model’s extents will be assumed to be the desired size of the celestial body in kilometers.</p></li>
<li><p>added clarifying text to the Adjust Object/Adjust Model panel to help users understand how the model will be handled internally by Vizard</p></li>
<li><p>added support for use of multiple Instrument Cameras in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opNav</span></code> mode</p></li>

<p><strong>Version 2.1.1 (Oct. 1, 2022)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>added support for loading spacecraft and celestial body models created by users
and saved as Addressable Bundles using the VizardCustomContent Unity project.
This Unity project will be released to users in the near future to allow custom
Addressable bundles that can be loaded at Vizard start-up and automatically applied
by supplying the desired model key for each body needing a custom model loaded and applied</p>
<ul>
<li><p>custom celestial body models will be scaled using the radius message in the celestial body submessage. If the radius field is not populated, the maximum dimension of the custom model will be used as the radius and the imported model will be assumed to be scaled in kilometers</p></li>
<li><p>custom spacecraft body models will be assumed to be sized 1 meter to 1 Unity Unit</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>added support for science cameras and opNav camera use of Unity’s Depth of Field
post-processing effects. Updated built-in post-processing to Unity Post Processing
Package 3.2.2. Vizard now support up to five different post processing profiles
(up to five different cameras can have different depth of field settings profiles,
more than five cameras will have to share settings). Added fields in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizMessage.proto</span></code> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CameraConfig</span></code> sub message to allow access to all the Unity
Depth of Field post-processing settings.</p></li>
<li><p>added support for Ellipsoids HUD. User can specify the creation of ellipsoidal shells using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizMessage.proto</span></code> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ellipsoid</span></code> sub message. Ellipsoids can be used to illustrate position uncertainty or keep-out zones.  They can be aligned with the spacecraft Hill or body frames.</p></li>
<li><p>changed appearance of Coarse Sun Sensor and Location HUD shells to use the shadowed shell material created for the Ellipsoid HUD. The appearance of these HUD shapes with the new material greatly improves user ability to interpret the shapes.</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in the chief spacecraft selection dropdown menu to ensure a new spacecraft selection updates the orbit line calculations of all spacecraft in scene</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in the relative osculating orbit calculations to correctly plot multiple orbits</p></li>
<li><p>removed internal handling for asteroids Bennu and Ryugu that would automatically specify the model key for objects named after these asteroids. Now the model key field must be populated by the user to apply the Bennu or Ryugu Addressable asset correctly (as was already true for all other asteroids included in the Asteroids bundle)</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in the true path trajectory plotting that occurred during live streaming when the position arrays of the chief spacecraft and the deputy spacecraft might temporarily be of different lengths</p></li>
<li><p>added setting in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizMessage.proto</span></code> and on the Settings panel to allow user to specify a different spacecraft scale in solar system view vs. spacecraft local or planet local views</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in Light HUD where light did not correctly hide when spacecraft was in Sprite mode</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.1.0 (May 25, 2022)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>moved the large asteroid and Martian moon models and the optional MilkyWay skybox to be Addressable Assets.
These are large assets that are rarely used. By making them Addressable Assets, they will no longer be
automatically loaded into memory by Vizard at the start and instead will only increase the Vizard
runtime memory footprint when in use.</p></li>
<li><p>added 6U and 3U cubeSat models that include reflective solar panels, they can be applied with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modelDictionaryKey</span></code> field in the Spacecraft vizMessage or by using the ModelDirectory GUI panel
(model keys are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6Usat</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3Usat</span></code>)</p></li>
<li><p>modified the spacecraft local view scaling to support self-shadowing on satellites with dimensions of less
than 1 meter: If the camera target spacecraft’s dimensions are less than 1 meter, the spacecraft local view
scale will increase from 1m to 1 Unity Units to 1m to 2UnityUnits/minimumSpacecraftMeshDimension. This scale
is applied to both size and distance, ensuring the relative position and size of the all objects in the scene
remains true to the simulated distances/sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>added customizable logo patches to the sides of all three built in spacecraft (BSKsat, 6U cubeSat,
and 3U cubeSat) that users can change by providing a path to their own image file as part of the Spacecraft
protobuffer message</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug with HD atmosphere not initializing correctly when its attached planet is specified in the
vizMessage as the camera target on start-up</p></li>
<li><p>improved the automatic resizing/repositioning of spacecraft HUD objects when their attached
spacecraft model is changed (takes into account the new dimensions and ensures the HUD
objects shrink or grow accordingly)</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug with Custom Cameras in headless mode not applying the user specified skybox</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.0.4 (March 12, 2022)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Updated <a class="reference internal" href="VizardGUI.html#vizardgui"><span class="std std-ref">User Guide</span></a> to list the built-in CAD shapes in Vizard to show planet and asteroid shapes</p></li>

now show up at the artificially large size of the other bodies in solar system view</p></li>
<li><p>added a setting to protobuffer so user can set the default size of celestial bodies in solar
system view</p></li>
<li><p>added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modelDictionaryKey</span></code> key field to both Spacecraft and Celestial Body sub messages to
allow users to specify one of the internally supported spacecraft or celestial body
models without having to match the model’s name to the object’s name (i.e. you could
use “Phobos” as an asteroid model)</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug in primary body calculation for custom celestial bodies</p></li>
<li><p>fixed bug with double clicking on celestial bodies in solar system view</p></li>
<li><p>made matching of supported celestial bodies with their included textures/models case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p>instrument camera skybox will correctly show the chosen skybox instead of always defaulting to black</p></li>
<li><p>camera skybox defaults to NASA SVS skybox</p></li>
<li><p>generic sensor labels stay off when HUD isHidden changes</p></li>
<li><p>made the setting of main camera near and far clipping planes dynamic to better
accommodate distant small objects</p></li>
<li><p>added a panel label string to the standard camera protobuffer settings, user
can also rename the camera panel view by clicking on the label and typing a new name in it</p></li>
<li><p>standard camera panel windows will open with the settings sub panel hidden if they
were automatically set up with a camera settings message for a cleaner appearance on start up</p></li>
<li><p>added settings to spacecraft sub message to allow user to set the colors of both the
osculating and true path trajectory lines</p></li>
<li><p>added setting to allow user to toggle showing the Mission Time in the playback bar on startup</p></li>

<li><p>added support to main camera hill frame following so that a transition across spheres of
influence can be correctly managed</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.0.3 (Dec. 15, 2021)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>built-in high vertex count models of Bennu and Ryugu asteroids. These models will automatically be
applied when a celestial body message’s name field contains the key word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bennu</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ryugu</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>added user configurable spot lights that can be placed as desired on any spacecraft object.
See <a class="reference internal" href="../examples/scenarioFormationBasic.html#scenarioformationbasic"><span class="std std-ref">scenarioFormationBasic</span></a> for an example use of a spacecraft light</p>

<li><p>each light has a label that can be turned on from the Labels panel under the View menu</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.0.2</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>added About Panel (under the File menu) to provide information Vizard, Basilisk, and about the third
party scripting assets as well as the many imagery, texture, and model assets that Vizard uses</p></li>
<li><p>sun light attenuation setting: enabling this will cause the lighting to dim as you move further
from the sun. This setting can be set under the General tab of the Settings panel or in the
vizMessage Settings message.</p></li>
<li><p>main light intensity setting: the user can set their own light intensity for the sun or the main
directional light (if no sun message present). This setting can be set under the General tab of the
Settings panel or in the vizMessage Settings message.</p></li>
<li><p>improved Saturn and Saturn’s Rings. Rings are now shadowed by the planet.</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.0.1</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fixed a start-up issue on Windows and Linux where the application only started up in full screen
mode that could not be exited.  Now the application starts in a Window.  You can start up
pressing Option or Windows key during start up to ensure the application starts in a size that fits
the monitor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.0.0</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The version 2.0 release main feature is the new improved atmosphere shader which is currently enabled on
Earth, Venus and Mars whenever one of these bodies is the camera target or the parent body of the camera
target in spacecraft local and planet local views. This is a computation intensive shader and is turned
off when these conditions are not met. The old Atmosphere scattering shader is enabled in all other cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The atmosphere rendering can be turned off completely using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atmospheresOff</span></code> user setting in
the protobuffer messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support in the new atmosphere shader for artificial nighttime albedo lighting</p></li>
<li><p>Added multipliers for distance to the planet view transition and hello view transition to allow the user
to zoom further out before triggering the transition (new vizMessage.proto file attached). This change
required some rescripting for how the transitions thresholds were set and used by various scripts,
but luckily a small change overall.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.9.2</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Apple Silicon compatible native file browser, Vizard can be run in M1 native mode</p></li>

<li><p>moved <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RelativeOrbitChief</span></code> setting to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LiveSettings</span></code> message to allow user to change the
relative orbit chief spacecraft by message automatically. Manually setting the relative orbit chief
is still available under the View menu.</p></li>
<li><p>added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MainCameraTarget</span></code> setting to the Settings message to allow user to designate the main camera’s
target on startup instead of defaulting to the first spacecraft in messages. The main camera target
at startup can also be set to any available celestial body.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.9.1</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>added Generic Sensor message to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vizMessage.proto</span></code> and HUD support in Vizard</p></li>

These cones can be toggled in the Ground Location panel.</p></li>
<li><p>If a spacecraft passes within the field of view of a Ground Location, a line indicating communication
will be drawn between the Ground Location and Spacecraft. If another body (planet, moon, or spacecraft)
occludes the spacecraft, the line will not be drawn. These lines can be toggled on the
Ground Location panel and are on by default.</p></li>
<li><p>Added labels for Ground Locations, a toggle in the Labels panel, and a protobuffer setting show/hide the labels</p></li>

<p><strong>Version 1.4.1</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The vizMessage thruster default and individual color settings are supported. You can also change the
default color setting in Settings panel and scale the length of the thruster plumes (make them half
as long, double, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The thruster panel now properly labels the thruster groups</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the thrust plumes is scaled to maxThrust until the maxThrust value is equal to or less
than 0.01N. All micro-thrusters below 0.01N in size are visualized as a very small thrust puff/plume.</p></li>
<li><p>This update also contains the ellipticity for all the celestial bodies we currently support.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a small bug in the Keep Out/In Cones. If you modified an existing cone and changed it’s type
(from Out to In or In to Out) the coneViolation flag was not reset so you could end up seeing erroneous
results until the state update was triggered. Now whenever an existing cone is modified that flag is reset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.4.0</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>keyboard camera rate controls now with hot-keys for zooming in and out (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">]</span></code>),
pan left and right (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">←</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">→</span></code>),
tilt up and down (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">↑</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">↓</span></code>), roll left and right (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>).  Pressing these keys
multiple times increases or decreases the camera rate</p></li>
<li><p>hot-key <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code> to stop all camera rates toggled with hot-keys</p></li>
<li><p>hot-key help panel (press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">h</span></code> to show or use button under view menu)</p></li>
<li><p>removed time display button under Time menu because we now use hot keys</p></li>
<li><p>switched to 3 quality levels for viz app (Fast, Good, and Beautiful) and confirmed that shadows are showing up in Beautiful even on the AVS model.  The Beautiful mode requires a good graphics card to yield a good frame rate.</p></li>
<li><p>added flashlight to camera, still toggled by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L</span></code>, useful to illuminate spacecraft when in shadow of a planet</p></li>
<li><p>fixed sun threshold bug that caused mesh not to show up from some angles</p></li>
<li><p>new timeline slider bar that live updates the rendered view</p></li>
<li><p>new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">File/Settings</span></code> option to bring up a settings panel to change system default values</p></li>

possible to cast shadows onto nearby spacecraft.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.3.0</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>added option for playback of messages in real time. Real time mode references the system clock and advances
messages as needed to keep pace with the current sim elapsed time of the message. Real time playback can be
increased or decreased from 1x with the playback speed controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Real Time or Frame Rate playback options can be selected under the new Time menu</p></li>
<li><p>playback speed display modified to show the current playback speed relative to real time rather than the old
frame rate speed</p></li>

display can be toggled under the Time menu or by pressing ‘d’ on the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>added epoch submessage to the vizMessage. If user omits epoch message, a default epoch of January 1, 2019 0h 0m 0s
is used</p></li>
<li><p>epoch message is used to calculate Mission Time display which can be toggled on from Time menu or by pressing
’t’ on the keyboard</p></li>
