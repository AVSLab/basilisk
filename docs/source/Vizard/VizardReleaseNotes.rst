Release Notes
=============


.. sidebar:: In Progress Features

    - Adding star tracker configuration visualization
    - Adding coarse sun sensor configuration visualization
    - Add ability to place the location of the standard camera relative to spacecraft
    - Visualizing the standard camera within the 3D window
    - Better automatic simulation data usage monitoring
    - general GUI enhancements
    - dynamic texture rendering
    - articulating CAD models
    - fuel tank visualization
    - better support for visualizing multiple spacecraft
    - add labels to spacecraft and sensor visualization


**Version 0.8.0**

- added ability to load in a custom CAD obj file to replace the default spacecraft model
- added the ability to replace any simulation object with a custom object or a default shape like sphere, cone, cylinder, etc.
- The camera view panel screen shot button now stores the PNG image in the user's home folder
- Changed how standard cameras work.  The user can invoke readily 2 standard cameras and specify for which spacecraft these are attached.  This scales much better with lots of spacecraft where before we attached 3 standard cameras to each spacecraft by default
- made it possible to launch Black Lion from command line
- Added option under File menu to compress simulation data



**Version 0.4.0**

- New option to set the ambient brightness
- New Camera menu option to select the target object
- General code fixes and improvements
- Added option to toggle off/on orbit illustration
- Added keyboard support to quit the application

**Version 0.3.0**

- Initial public release of the new Unity based Basilisk visualization tool.
- This tool is able to illustrate spacecraft translational position, trajectory, orientation and primary celestial bodies.
- Currently this public Vizard copy support saving Basilisk simulation data to file to be then viewed in Vizard.
- In development feature is being able to live stream Basilisk simulation data to Vizard directly
- The Visualization can show a spacecraft centric view (default), a planet centric view (enabled by double clicking on planet or zooming out even further), and a heliocentric view (by zoom out even further)
- Spacecraft and planet axes can be toggled on or off
- Screen size can by dynamically changed
- The menu bar at the top is dynamic in that it only shows device options if such devices are actually modeled and sent as messages to Vizard.
- Heads-up visualization of the thrusters is possible
- Device state panels can be enables for Reaction Wheels or Thrusters
- Separate camera views can be invoked to get perspectives from the spacecraft along particular body-fixed directions
- Direction vectors can be added from the spacecraft to other object to always illustrate the heading to the sun, the Earth, etc.
- Keep-out and keep-in zones can be set within Vizard to visualize if a celestial object is visible within a body-fixed cone.  This enables checking if a solar panel axis is within some degrees of the sun, or checking that a sensor axis is outside a cone relative to the sun.
