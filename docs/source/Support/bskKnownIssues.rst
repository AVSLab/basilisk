Basilisk Known Issues
=====================

.. caution::

    The use of ``cMsgCInterfacePy`` is depreciated.  Use ``messaging`` instead.

Version |release|
-----------------
- There was an issue with :ref:`thrusterStateEffector` where if there are multiple instances of the
  thruster state effector then the last effector will over-write all the state of the earlier thrusters.
  This is corrected in the current release.
- Doing a clean Basilisk build with `opNav` flag on fails building openCV.  The conan
  install script is updated this is corrected in the current release.
- We found a slow memory leak if messages with arrays or vectors were accessed from python.  The ``swig``
  issue has now been fixed in the current release.

Version 2.2.0
-------------
- VizInterface has been updated to use 4.5.0 version of ZMQ library.  Be sure to use Vizard 2.1.5 or newer.

Version 2.1.7
-------------
- The way to include effector bodies in Vizard has changed in this release.
- The streaming between ``vizInterface`` and Vizard was not reliable because of a ZMQ compatibility
  issue between the two code bases.  BSK is reverting to using ZMQ 4.3.0 for now to avoid this issue.
- Building Basilisk with ``opNav`` mode was no longer working as a conan package dependency issue came up.
  This has been corrected in the new version by specifying ``xz_utils/5.4.0`` in ``conanfile.py``.  Note
  that building with ``opNav`` now also appears to require ``conan>=1.59.0``, but less than 2.0.0.

Version 2.1.6
-------------
- in :ref:`boreAngCalc`, the variable ``boreVecPoint`` is now called ``boreVec_Po``.

Version 2.1.5
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found
  when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- :ref:`hingedRigidBodyStateEffector` and :ref:`dualHingedRigidBodyStateEffector` module inertial state outputs are relative to the central gravity body,
  not the inertial frame.  This is now corrected.
- Adding an instrument camera to :ref:`vizInterface` has changed.  See :ref:`vizardSettings` on how
  to use the new method ``addCamMsgToModule()``.

Version 2.1.4
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found
  when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- prior version had a bug in computer the latitude in ``PCPF2LLA()`` inside :ref:`geodeticConversion`.  This is used
  in the ``specifyLocationPCPF()`` method inside :ref:`groundLocation`, and in
  :ref:`msisAtmosphere` and :ref:`albedo`.
- :ref:`coarsesunsensor` now receives in ``sensorList`` a list of CSS configuration state pointers, not
  a copy to the configuration structures.  This allows these values to be changed on the fly from
  within python.  However, the simulation code must ensure that the CSS configuration structures
  are retained in memory or a segmentation fault will ensue.
- How stand alone C-wrapped message objects are created in python has moved from ``cMsgCInterfacePy``
  to ``messaging``.  Old scripts still using ``cMsgCInterfacePy`` still work as a link has been
  created to ``messaging``.  But, the use of ``cMsgCInterfacePy`` is no depreciated and code should
  be updated to using ``messaging`` instead.
- The use of custom message in the external modules folders is broke with the new build
  modification in this release.  This is fixed in the latest release.

Version 2.1.3
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found
  when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- :ref:`planetEphemeris` was not computing the correct orientation, this is fixed in current release
- updated ``examples/OpNavScenarios/BSK_OpNav.py`` path to the Vizard binary. If you are calling
  Vizard 2.1+ from the python script, the Vizard binary name changed from ``Basilisk Vizard` to
  simply ``Vizard``.
- using newer versions of Python, such as 3.9.13 or 3.10.5, running ``conanfile.py`` runs into errors
  and fails.  This is now addressed in the next release.  Upgrading ``pip`` to the newest version
  manually can resolve this issue as well.

Version 2.1.2
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found
  when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- ``conan`` version 1.44 is causing build issues because the way the source and build folders are set has
  changed.  This is fixed in current version of Basilisk.
- building Basilisk from scratch with ``opNav`` turned on was failing because ``conan`` was not able to
  install ``opencv/4.1.1``.  In particular, the package ``jasper`` was now failing as a required argument
  is no longer supported.  This is fixed in the current release by turning off this ``jasper`` requirement.

Version 2.1.1
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- On windows when building with ``opNav`` mode on,
  the ``gettext`` library was not included with the ``conan`` software unless the version is 0.21,
  not 0.20.1.  This dependency has been upgraded.  This might require deleting the ``.conan`` folder in your
  home directory and re-installing all dependencies.


Version 2.1.0
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- ``conan`` changed the default repos in version 1.40 onwards which broke the Basilisk installation.
  This is now corrected in the latest release.  After pulling the latest code release, you'll need to
  delete the ``.conan`` folder in your home directory to create a fresh copy.  This only has to be done once.
- :ref:`spacecraftReconfig` has been changed to read in the spacecraft mass from an input message, not be set as
  a module variable


Version 2.0.7
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- Over the summer of 2020 the ``conan`` repo wasn't able to install ``opencv`` anymore.  The current build
  fixes this issue and lets Basilisk be compiled with the ``opNav`` flag again.

Version 2.0.6
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 2.0.5
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 2.0.4
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 2.0.3
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 2.0.2
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- On Windows, using Python 3.8 or higher resulted in Basilisk paths not being recognized due to a chance with how
  Python resolves paths on Windows.  This is fixed in the next release.

Version 2.0.1
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 2.0.0
-------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.10
--------------
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.9

- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.8

- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.7

- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.6

- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.5

- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found when opNav is included.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

Version 1.8.4

- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

**Version 1.8.3**

- On Windows the ``vizInterface`` and all ``opNav`` related modules is not properly linking.
  Thus, all associated modules, including saving to Vizard binaries, is not working in this version.
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

**Version 1.8.2**

- On Linux and Windows the ``vizInterface`` and all ``opNav`` related modules is not properly linking.
  Thus, all associated modules, including saving to Vizard binaries, is not working in this version.
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.

**Version 1.8.1**

- When deleting ``.conan`` and doing a build with ``opNav`` set to true, the required dependencies can't be found
  on the repo on the first install run.  Running it again makes it work.  This is fixed in the next release to run
  properly on the first try.
- If ``openCV`` is conan installed for Release only the Xcode would give false error messages that it can't
  find the library.  This is now fixed in the current release.
- In Xcode, when editing ``vizInterface.c/h`` files, the protobuffer library is not properly found.
  The code compiles, but auto-completion etc. doesn't work in that module.
- On Linux and Windows the ``vizInterface`` and all ``opNav`` related modules is not properly linking.
  Thus, all associated modules, including saving to Vizard binaries, is not working in this version.

**Version 1.8.0**

- The new conan based built system might need the conan cache folder ``.conan`` to be deleted and reset.  This is
  typically in the user's home folder.  After this you need to re-run the conan setup commands::

    $ conan remote add conan-community https://api.bintray.com/conan/conan-community/conan
    $ conan remote add bincrafters https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan

- If running Windows the path to the Basilisk library destination folder must be set, see :ref:`installWindows`.
- On Linux and Windows the ``vizInterface`` and all ``opNav`` related modules is not properly linking.
  Thus, all associated modules, including saving to Vizard binaries, is not working in this version.
- If running Windows, be sure to use ``pip install conan`` to get conan, and don't download the binary installer,
  see :ref:`installWindows`.   The binary installer causes several issues with this new build system in that
  it contains its own copy of Python, and thus checking for required python packages does work.
- The new build system provides many speed improvements in doing a clean or partial build, but some small changes are
  required to update BSK python simulation scripts to be compatible with the new build system.
  These changes include:

  - In BSK python simulation scripts, BSK modules should be included using the indirect method.  Thus::

        from Basilisk.fswAlgorithms.cModuleTemplate import cModuleTemplate

    becomes::

        from Basilisk.fswAlgorithms import cModuleTemplate

  - The ``pyswice`` package is now imported from ``topLevelModule``.  Thus::

        from Basilisk import pyswice

    becomes::

        from Basilisk.topLevelModules import pyswice

  - The support file ``pyswice_ck_utilities.py`` has become a regular suppoort file in ``src/utiliites``.  Thus,
    it is imported using::

        import Basilisk.pyswice.pyswice_ck_utilities

  - Similarly, ``pyswice_spk_utilities.py`` has moved to the utilities folder. To include ``spkRead`` function replace::

        from Basilisk.pyswice.pyswice_spk_utilities import spkRead

    with::

        from Basilisk.utilities.pyswice_spk_utilities import spkRead

  - To include ``loadGravFromFileToList`` function replace::

        from Basilisk.simulation.gravityEffector.gravCoeffOps import loadGravFromFileToList

    with::

        from Basilisk.simulation.gravityEffector import loadGravFromFileToList

- If you have written custom BSK modules outside of the BSK distribution, the swig ``*.i`` files and some code files
  will need to be adjusted as follows:

  - To include the ``swig_common_model.i`` file, replace::

        %include "swig_common_model.i"

    with::

        %pythoncode %{
        from Basilisk.simulation.swig_common_model import *
        %}

  - If Eigen variables are being swig'd, then import::

        %include "swig_eigen.i"

  - To swig C arrays of variables, then import::

        %include "swig_conly_data.i"

  - To provide support of C++ ``std::string`` `types <http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Library.html#Library_nn14>`__, then import::

        %include "std_string.i"

  - To provide support of C++ ``std::vector`` `class <http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Library.html#Library_nn15>`__, then import::

        %include "std_vector.i"

- The files in ``_GeneralModuleFiles`` folders are now built into a separate library with the parent folders name
  plus ``Lib``.
  This means in the IDE like Xcode and Visual Studio the code in ``_GeneralModuleFiles`` is shown in a folder with
  this library name.  Thus, for example, code in ``src/simulation/environment/_GeneralModuleFiles``
  are shown in the IDE folder ``environmentLib`` within the ``environment`` parent folder.  This keeps the BSK
  folders cleaner and with less duplicated code being displayed.
- A new python package dependency is ``Pillow``.  This is needed for the test scripts for :ref:`camera` to run.
- In Xcode the build will complain that it can't find the ``<Eigen/Dense>`` library.  The code compiles ok.  The work
  around this conan issue is to run the build twice, once for Debug and once for Release.  At that point it can
  be run just once.

**Version 1.7.5**

- :ref:`groundLocation` was not converting between the planet and inertial frame correctly.  This is now fixed in
  the later releases.

**Version 1.7.4**

- None

Version 1.7.3

- On Windows Basilisk didn't compile due to missing math ``#define`` delaration in ``geodeticConversion.cpp/h``.
  This is fixed in the latest release.

**Version 1.7.2**

- None

**Version 1.7.1**

- None

**Version 1.7.0**

- None

**Version 1.6.0**

- None

**Version 1.5.1**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.

**Version 1.5.0**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.
- Here the reaction wheel dynamics have been modified such that the RW state output message is no longer hard-coded to ``rw_config_0_data``, etc.  Rather, now the ``ModelTag`` string is pre-pended to make this output msg name unique with.  Any scripts that is logging this RW state message will have to be updated.  The reason for this change is to allow multiple spacecraft to have RW devices and unique RW state messages.
- There was an issue doing a clean compile using Python 2 which is addressed in the next version
- :ref:`test_reactionWheelStateEffector_integrated` didn't run on Python 2, this is fixed in the next version.

**Version 1.4.2**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.

**Version 1.4.1**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.
- We ran into issues compiling on Linux where ``libsodium`` and ``conan`` were not compiling properly  This is fixed in the next point release.

**Version 1.4.0**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.
- ``BSK_PRINT`` has been replaced within Basilisk modules using :ref:`bskLogging` (for C++) and ``_bskLog`` (for C).
- WINDOWS ONLY: there appears to be an issue compiling ``vizInterface`` with the new bskLog method on Windows.  We are working a point release that will fix this.

**Version 1.3.2**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.

**Version 1.3.1**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.

**Version 1.3.0**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.

**Version 1.2.1**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.


**Version 1.2.0**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.
- The magnetometer unit tests don't pass on all platforms. This is corrected in the next release.

**Version 1.1.0**

- WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This should result in appropriate behavior.  Right now there is no known solution to this issue.
- the unit tests of the magnetometer module don't pass on all operating systems as the test tolerances are too tight.  This is resolved in the next release.

WINDOWS ONLY: Windows users cannot currently run pytest directly on
Basilisk ``src/`` directory (there will be non-resolved python path
issues that will result in erroneous ImportErrors). Instead, to verify
proper installation of Basilisk, windows users must enter the specific
subdirectory they are attempting to test, only then to run pytest. This
should result in appropriate behavior. Right now there is no known
solution to this issue.

the ``exponentialAtmosphere`` module has been replaced with a module
based on the new atmospheric density base class. BSK simulations that
used the older module must update to use the new module. The module unit
test scripts illustrate how to use this module, and the module PDF
documentation discusses this as well. The ``dragEffector`` integrated
test is also updated to make use of the new module

setting this needs to be updated to not set this parameter anymore.

The ``numpy`` python package can’t be the current version 1.16.x as this
causes some incompatibilities and massive amounts of depreciated
warnings. These warnings are not related to BSK python code, but other
support code. Thus, for now be sure to install version 1.15.14 of
``numpy``.

As we are now using the conan package management system, you can’t
double the the Cmake GUI application. Instead, you must either launch
the Cmake GUI application from the command line, or run CMake from the
command line directly. See the platform specific Basilisk installation
instructions.

RadiationPressure module unit test. We are still investigating. In the
meantime, using pytest version 3.6.1 is working correctly.
