Setup On Linux
==============

Software setup
--------------

In order to run Basilisk, the following software will be necessary. This document outline how to install this support software.

-  `Cmake <https://cmake.org/>`__ 3.14 or higher
-  `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ 3.8.x or greater.  The following python package dependencies are automatically
   checked and installed in the steps below.

   - .. include:: ../bskPkgRequired.txt

-  `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`__ (version 3 or 4)
-  `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`__
-  (Optional) Get the `GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com>`__
   application to be able to pull and manage a copy of Basilisk

.. caution::

    Building Basilisk on Linux using Intel processors is being regularly tested.
    With Basilisk version 2.1.5 we added
    experimental support for Linux on ARM processors.  However, this option is not currently
    tested on a regular manner.

Dependencies
------------

.. Note:: Depending on your system setup, administrative permissions (sudo or su) may be required to install these dependencies. Some distributions of Linux will use other package management commands such as ``yum``, ``dnf``, of ``pgk``.

#. On a new Linux system various developer packages and support libraries are requried::

       # Update current software
       $ apt-get update

       # Get GIT for source code version control
       # apt-get install git

       # Helpful for Debian systems -  all packages need to compile such as gcc and g++ compilers and other utils.
       $ apt-get install build-essential

       # Install Python 3
       $ apt-get install python3

       # Package development process library to facilitate packaging Python packages
       $ apt-get install python3-setuptools

       # ensure that the python developer libraries are installed
       $ apt-get install python3-dev

       # Tkinter
       $ apt-get install python3-tk

       # Python PIP
       $ apt-get install python3-pip

       #Check python version installed
       $ python3 --version

       #Python virtual environment with same version as Python. For example, python3.7-venv for python3.7.x
       $apt-get install python3.x-venv

#. SWIG: Available using::

    $ apt-get install swig

#. A C/C++ Compiler: This is included by default with most Linux systems (``gcc``), but is necessary to build Basilisk.

#. A Git compatible version control tool like `SourceTree <http://sourcetreeapp.com>`__ should be used to :ref:`pull/clone <pullCloneBSK>` the Basilisk repository.

#. Using a Python Virtual Environment

   .. attention:: We strongly recommend using a python virtual environment while installing basilisk or running basilisk modules.
      For more info, `read this <https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`__.
      The virtual environment has the benefit that you won't have conflicts with other versions of Python or
      python packages that your computer has installed.  It lets you install packages specific to this environment
      and they won't interfere with other python projects you may have.
      However, you must turn this environment on and off each time you want to use it.

   The following steps show how to create, active ad de-activate a virtual environment.  The remaining installation
   steps work regardless if done within a virtual environment or not.

   - In a Terminal window change your current directory to be the Basilisk folder,
     then create a virtual environment using::

        $ python3 -m venv .venv

     This creates a hidden folder inside the Basilisk folder which will store all the python packages and
     environment information.

   - Activate virtual environment when needing configure, build or run Basilisk::

        $ source .venv/bin/activate

     The above step will add (venv) before the prompt.

   - Deactivate the virtual environment to return to the normal operating system environment::

        (venv) $ deactivate

#. Ensure ``wheel`` is installed and install ``conan`` using pip, an example is below::

       (venv) $ pip3 install wheel 'conan<2.0'

   The conan repositories information is automatically setup by ``conanfile.py``.

   .. warning::

      If you are upgrading from a version of Basilisk prior to 1.8.0, be sure to delete the ``.conan`` folder in your
      home directory to create a clean copy compatible with the current build system.

#. CMake: You can install cmake using pip3.  This makes it easy to overcome limitations of which version of ``cmake``
   the ``apt-get`` command provides::

       (venv) $ pip3 install cmake

#. Note, if are you not using a virtual environment and you choose to install python packages
   local in your user directory ``.local`` folder, be sure to add
   ``~/.local/bin`` to your ``PATH`` variable.

#. `Optional Packages:` The above directions install the Basilisk base software. There are a series of :ref:`optional packages<installOptionalPackages>` that enhance this capability.

Build Process via Terminal
--------------------------

#. The ``conanfile.py`` will setup, configure and run the Basilisk build.  For a basic installation,
   from the root Basilisk folder use::

        (venv) $ python3 conanfile.py

   For other configure and build options, see :ref:`configureBuild`.
   This process will verify that the minimum required Basilisk python packages are installed, and that
   the version is correct.  If not, the user is prompted to install the package with ``pip3`` in the system or user
   folder.

#. To test your setup you can run one of the :ref:`examples`:

   -  For example, in the terminal window, switch ``/basilisk/examples/`` to the
      current directory.
   -  Run one of the example scripts, such as::

       (venv) $ python3 scenarioBasicOrbit.py


Building the Project Separately
-------------------------------
If you are developing new modules you often just want to configure the Basilisk project file without compiling.

#. Run this command to only configure and not build the Basilisk project::

      python conanfile.py --buildProject False

   This will disable the build workflow so that you can build the project separately.

#. Next, move to the distribution folder to build using a makefile::

        (venv) $ cd dist3

#. You can do a multi core make by running ``make -j<number of cores +1>`` such as::

       (venv) $ make -j5
