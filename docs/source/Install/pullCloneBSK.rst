The Basilisk software framework source code is openly hosted on `Bitbucket.org <https://Bitbucket.org>`_.
Go to https://bitbucket.org/avslab/basilisk, log in with your Bitbucket account and download (see below)
or :ref:`fork <makeBskFork>` a copy of the Basilisk code.  As this is the raw source code, you need to
next :ref:`install <bskInstall>` and compile the code before you can run it.


The Basilisk frameworked is developed using the Git version control system.  The following directions explain how to
clone or pull a copy from the repository.

#. If needed, create your own `bitbucket.org <http://bitbucket.org>`__ account

#. Use a browser to go to the `Basilisk Bitbucket
   Repository <https://bitbucket.org/avslab/basilisk>`__

#. Click on the Clone button on this page, and select the ``https``
   option instead of the ssh option

#. Copy the project url (omit ``git clone``) from the bitbucket clone panel

#. Clone into preferred Git client (Source Tree for instance), or just clone the repository in the directory containing Basilisk. In SourceTree, use ``clone from url``, add the Basilisk repository url (without ``.git`` on the end), and select ``develop`` branch to pull the latest code.
