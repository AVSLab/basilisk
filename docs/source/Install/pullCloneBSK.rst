Download Source Code
====================

.. important::

    The Basilisk repo has moved from BitBucket to GitHub.  If you already downloaded the source
    code, it is recommended that you download a fresh copy.

The Basilisk software framework source code is openly hosted on `github.org <https://github.com>`_.
Go to https://github.com/AVSLab/basilisk, log in with your GitHub account and download (see below).
As this is the raw source code, you need to
next :ref:`install <bskInstall>` and compile the code before you can run it.


The Basilisk framework is developed using the Git version control system.  The following directions explain how to
clone or pull a copy from the repository.

#. If you have not already installed ``lfs`` (Large File Storage) system, go to `Git LFS Support Page <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage>`__ to download and install ``lfs`` before pulling the Basilisk repo.

#. If needed, create your own `github.org <http://github.com>`__ account

#. Use a browser to go to the `Basilisk GitHub
   Repository <https://github.com/AVSLab/basilisk>`__

#. In the "Quick setup" section select the ``https`` option instead of the ssh option

#. Copy the project url ``https://github.com/AVSLab/basilisk.git`` from the GitHub clone panel

#. Clone into preferred Git client (Source Tree for instance), or just clone the repository in the directory containing Basilisk. In SourceTree, use ``clone from url``, add the Basilisk repository url and select ``develop`` branch to pull the latest code.
