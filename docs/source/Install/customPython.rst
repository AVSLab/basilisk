Using a Custom Python Installation
==================================

The following instructions are guidelines on how to run Basilisk with a
computer that is not using a system installed version of Python.

-  Basilisk must be built and run with the same Python binary.
   For example, you cannot build for Python 3.8 and run against Python 3.9.
-  The best way to work with different versions of python installed on your computer is to setup
   a virtual python environment, such as with ``venv``.  In this case only that python used to create the
   virtual environment is available and conflicts with other versions are avoided.
-  If you use a virtual environment, but sure to build Basilisk in that virtual environment for the simulation
   script to function.  For example, within the virtual environment type ``python --version`` to check
   that the correct version of python is called with the ``python`` command.  On Linux and macOS, you can
   also check what python version the ``python3`` command uses.  Alternatively, calling
   ``where python`` will show you what python option there are, and what version will be called by
   looking for the top entry.
