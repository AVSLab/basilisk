Setup On macOS
==============

These instruction outline how to install Basilisk (BSK) on a clean version of macOS.
Basilisk requires the use of Python 3.8.x or greater.

The following python package dependencies are automatically checked and installed in the steps below.

- .. include:: ../bskPkgRequired.txt

.. attention::
    If you are running a new Apple computer with the M-series ARM64 processor, be sure to download a
    version of Python that is compatible with M-series processor.  The
    `Python.org <https://python.org>`__ web site contains Universal binaries for Python 3.9 and
    onward.  Regarding the python packages via ``pip`` and ``brew``, the required packages
    can all be installed readily in a native form using the standard installation instructions below.


Developer Software Tools
------------------------

In order to run Basilisk on macOS, the following software is necessary:

#. Get the `Apple Xcode
   Developer <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>`__
   tool from the App Store

   -  After Xcode is installed, start up the program to let it finish installing development components
   -  Open a Terminal window to install the command line tools using::

        $ xcode-select --install

#. (Optional) Get the `SourceTree <http://sourcetreeapp.com>`__ or `GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com>`__
   application to be able to pull and manage a copy of Basilisk
#. (Optional) Get the `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__
   application to be able to edit python source files

Install Python 3
----------------
To install Python 3 on macOS there are two common options:

#. (Preferred) Download the installer package from `python.org <https://python.org>`__.  This will configure your
   your macOS environment for Python 3 and can readily be upgraded by downloaded a newer installer package.
#. Install python 3 through the `HomeBrew <http://brew.sh>`__ package management system. The site has the
   command line to install homebrew from a terminal window using ``brew install python3``.

Install HomeBrew Support Packages
---------------------------------

#. Install `HomeBrew <http://brew.sh>`__ using a Terminal window and
   pasting the install script from the HomeBrew web site.

#. The new SWIG version 4 is compatible with Basilisk. Install the SWIG software package using::

   $ brew install swig

#. If you want to install the HomeBrew version of ``cmake``, you can do so with::

   $ brew install cmake
   $ brew link cmake

   You need at least version 3.14 or higher.

Setting up the Python Environment
---------------------------------

.. Note:: The following instructions recommend installing all the required python packages
   either in a virtual environment or in the user ``~/Library/Python`` folder. This has the benefit that
   no ``sudo`` command is required to install and run Basilisk, and the user Python folder can readily
   be replaced if needed. If you are familiar with python you can install in other locations as well.

.. Note:: If you wish to use the HomeBrew version of python, or generally have multiple copies of
   python installed on your system, configure the CMake Python paths as described in
   :ref:`customPython` after following these instructions.

.. Note:: We suggest you remove any other python packages (such as Anaconda), or change the path in
   your terminal shell if you really want to keep it.

In the following instructions, be sure to follow the sequence of tasks as outlined below.


Using A Python Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. attention:: We strongly recommend using a python virtual environment while installing basilisk or running basilisk modules.
    For more info, `read this <https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`__.
    The virtual environment has the benefit that you won't have conflicts with other versions of Python or
    python packages that your computer has installed.  It lets you install packages specific to this environment
    and they won't interfere with other python projects you may have.
    However, you must turn this environment on and off each time you want to use it.

The following steps show how to create, active ad de-activate a virtual environment.  The remaining installation
steps work regardless if done within a virtual environment or not.

- In a Terminal window change your current directory to be the Basilisk folder,
  then create a virtual environment using::

    $ python3 -m venv .venv

  This creates a hidden folder inside the Basilisk folder which will store all the python packages and
  environment information.

- Activate virtual environment when needing configure, build or run Basilisk::

    $ source .venv/bin/activate

  The above step will add (.venv) before the prompt.

- Deactivate the virtual environment to return to the normal operating system environment::

    (.venv) $ deactivate

Installing required python support packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  Basilisk uses ``conan`` for package managing. In order to do so, users
   must ensure ``wheel`` is installed and install ``conan``::

       (.venv) $ pip3 install wheel 'conan<2.0'

   The conan repositories information is automatically setup by ``conanfile.py``.


   .. warning::

      If you are upgrading from a version of Basilisk prior to 1.8.0, be sure to delete the ``.conan`` folder in your
      home directory to create a clean copy compatible with the current build system.

- The following python packages are the minimum required packages for Basilisk.  They are installed and checked
  for the correction version in the steps below.

  - .. include:: ../bskPkgRequired.txt

-  `Optional Packages:` The above directions install the Basilisk base software. There are a series of :ref:`optional packages<installOptionalPackages>` that enhance this capability, including ``pytest`` to run an automated test suite of unit and integrated tests.

Build Project Process via Terminal
----------------------------------

When all the prerequisite installations are complete, the project can be built as follows.

#. The ``conanfile.py`` will setup, configure and run the Basilisk build.  For a basic installation,
   from the root Basilisk folder use::

        (.venv) $ python3 conanfile.py

   For other configure and build options, see :ref:`configureBuild`.  This creates the Xcode project in
   ``dist3``.

   .. Warning:: Note that the default configuration is building for Release.  When you open the project in XCode, note
        that you need to build for profiling.  Otherwise you get errors about not being able to find appropriate
        conan installed libraries.

   The ``python3 conanfile.py`` process will verify that the minimum required Basilisk python packages are installed, and that
   the version is correct.  If not, the user is prompted to install the package with ``pip3`` in the system or user
   folder.

   .. Note:: If you wish to use the another version of python 3 configure the Python paths in :ref:`customPython`

   .. Warning:: If you get an error message in `cmake` saying it canâ€™t find the compiler tools, open a Terminal window and type::

        $ xcode-select -p

      This should return::

        /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

      If instead you get a different director such as ``/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools``, then correct this compiler directory path using::

        sudo xcode-select --reset

      Now clear the Cmake cache and try running the configure and build process again.

#. To test your setup you can run one of the :ref:`examples`:

   -  For example, in the terminal window, make ``basilisk/examples/`` the
      current directory.
   -  Run one of the tutorial scenarios, such as::

       (.venv) $ python3 scenarioBasicOrbit.py


Building with IDE
-----------------
Conan file will build the project by default.  However, this can take longer to compile than building the
Basilisk project in Xcode directly.  Further, if you are developing for Basilisk you often just want to configure
the Basilisk Xcode project file and not build right away. To change the default behavior disable the automatic build
using:

#. Set the ``buildProject`` argument to ``False`` using::

    (venv) $ python3 conanfile.py --buildProject False

#. Open the Xcode project file inside ``dist3``.  This is ``basilisk.xcodeproj`` on macOS.

   -  The source code should appear and be ready for use

      .. image:: /_images/static/256564102-xcode.png
         :align: center
         :scale: 40%
   -  Ensure that the target scheme is set to ``ALL_BUILD`` as shown in figure above
   -  Within Xcode now go under `Product/Build For/Profiling` to build for Release.
