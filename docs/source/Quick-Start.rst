.. sidebar:: Learning Basilisk

    This quick start guide provides a convenient location to learn about the fundamentals of the Basilisk (BSK) astrodynamics simulation framework, how to program a spacecraft simulation in BSK, as well as how to code modules.  These sections are presented started with basic fundamentals and then become more detailed.

    Further, complete simulation examples are presented in the last section.  They are a convenient source to see how particular modules are used in an integrated manner.  Next, most modules contain a ``_UnitTest`` sub-folder which contains one or more test scripts to check the functions of a module.  This too can be a good source of information on how to setup and use a particular module.

    Most modules contains some documentation in either an RST format (preferred) or using a TeX'd PDF document inside the ``_Documentation`` sub-folder within the module.  The RST file is used to generated the HTML web pages you are viewing.  Here the basic module functionality is summarized and all input and output messages are listed.  Either the RST or PDF documentation explains the mathematics used in the module, or cites the paper or textbook where the algorithm can be found.

    Finally, there is the source-code itself.  That is always the ultimate guide to see what a module is doing.

This Basilisk guide explains how to make use of the Basilisk framework.  If you are looking for examples
