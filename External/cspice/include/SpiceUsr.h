-Particulars

   This file is an umbrella header that includes all header files 
   required to support the CSPICE application programming interface
   (API).  Users' application code that calls CSPICE need include only
   this single header file.  This file includes function prototypes for 
   the entire set of CSPICE routines.  Typedef statements used to create
   SPICE data types are also included.
   
   
   About SPICE data types
   ======================
   
   To assist with long-term maintainability of CSPICE, NAIF has elected
   to use typedefs to represent data types occurring in argument lists
   and as return values of CSPICE functions. These are:
 
      SpiceBoolean
      SpiceChar
      SpiceDouble
      SpiceInt
      ConstSpiceBoolean
      ConstSpiceChar
      ConstSpiceDouble
      ConstSpiceInt
 
   The SPICE typedefs map in an arguably natural way to ANSI C types:
 
      SpiceBoolean -> enum { SPICEFALSE = 0, SPICETRUE = 1 }
      SpiceChar    -> char
      SpiceDouble  -> double
      SpiceInt     -> int or long
      ConstX       -> const X  (X = any of the above types)
 
   The type SpiceInt is a special case: the corresponding type is picked
   so as to be half the size of a double. On all currently supported
   platforms, type double occupies 8 bytes and type int occupies 4 
   bytes.  Other platforms may require a SpiceInt to map to type long.
 
   While other data types may be used internally in CSPICE, no other
   types appear in the API.
      
   
   About CSPICE function prototypes
   ================================ 
   
   Because CSPICE function prototypes enable substantial compile-time
   error checking, we recommend that user applications always reference
   them.  Including the header file SpiceUsr.h in any module that calls
   CSPICE will automatically make the prototypes available.
      
      
   About CSPICE C style
   ====================
   
   CSPICE is written in ANSI C.  No attempt has been made to support K&R
   conventions or restrictions.
   
   
   About C++ compatibility
   =======================
   
   The preprocessor directive -D__cplusplus should be used when 
   compiling C++ source code that includes this header file.  This 
   directive will suppress mangling of CSPICE names, permitting linkage
   to a CSPICE object library built from object modules produced by
   an ANSI C compiler.
   
-Literature_References

   None.

-Restrictions

   The #include statements contained in this file are not part of 
   the CSPICE API.  The set of files included may change without notice.
   Users should not include these files directly in their own
   application code.
   
-Version

   -CSPICE Version 5.0.0, 11-MAY-2012 (NJB) (SCK) 

      Updated to include header files

        SpiceErr.h
        SpiceFrm.h
        SpiceOccult.h

   -CSPICE Version 4.0.0, 30-SEP-2008 (NJB) 

      Updated to include header file

        SpiceGF.h

   -CSPICE Version 3.0.0, 19-AUG-2002 (NJB) 

      Updated to include header files
