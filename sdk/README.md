# Basilisk SDK

This package publishes the Basilisk plugin SDK so that external projects can
build Basilisk-compatible SWIG based plugins without vendoring the full simulation
codebase. It ships curated Basilisk headers, SWIG interface files and typemaps,
message auto-generation tools, and CMake helper functions for building SWIG
modules out-of-tree.
