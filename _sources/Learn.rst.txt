.. sidebar:: Quick-Start Guide

    If you are looking for examples
    to run, jump directly to :ref:`examples` section.  For example, :ref:`scenarioBasicOrbit` is a great place to have a quick start on doing an orbital simulation, while :ref:`scenarioAttitudeFeedback` is a good script to see how to do basic attitude control.

This guide provides a convenient location to learn about the fundamentals of the Basilisk (BSK) astrodynamics simulation framework, how to program a spacecraft simulation in BSK, as well as how to code modules.  These sections are presented started with basic fundamentals and then become more detailed.

Further, complete simulation examples are presented in the :ref:`examples` section.  They are a convenient source to see how particular modules are used in an integrated manner.  Next, most modules contain a ``_UnitTest`` sub-folder which contains one or more test scripts to check the functions of a module.  This too can be a good source of information on how to setup and use a particular module.

Information about the various modules or architecture files are found in :ref:`Folder_Documentation`. Here the basic module functionality is summarized and all input and output messages are listed.

Finally, there is the source-code itself.  That is always the ultimate guide to see what a module is doing.
