Overview
--------

This scenario demonstrates how to set up a spacecraft orbiting a celestial body. The gravity can be a first order
approximation or run with high-order spherical harmonic terms.  The following diagram illustrates how the
Basilisk components are interconnected.

.. image:: /_images/static/test_scenarioBasicOrbit.svg
   :align: center

The script is found in the folder ``basilisk/examples`` and executed by using::

    python3 scenarioBasicOrbit.py

.. important:: This scenario is currently the most minimal example available. It doesn't make sense consider
                   returning to the :ref:`examples` before moving on.


Making a Copy of the Example Basilisk Scenario Script
-----------------------------------------------------

To play with any scenario scripts as tutorials, you should make a copy of
them into a custom folder outside of the Basilisk directory.

To copy them, first find the location of the Basilisk installation. After installing, you can find the
installed location of Basilisk by opening a python interpreter and running the commands:

.. code-block:: python

   import Basilisk
   basiliskPath = Basilisk.__path__[0]
   print basiliskPath

Copy the folder ``{basiliskPath}/examples`` into a new folder in a different directory.
Now, when you want to use a tutorial, navigate inside that folder, and edit and execute the copied integrated tests.


Enable Terminal Bar to Show Simulation Progress
-----------------------------------------------

To enable progress bar, one need to set ``showProgressBar`` data member of class SimulationBaseClass to true.

.. code-block:: python

     scSim = SimulationBaseClass.SimBaseClass()
     scSim.SetProgressBar(True)

Method ``SetProgressBar`` should be used to set variable ``showProgressBar`` as True with the above statement. After
enabling the progress bar, all the simulation run by ``scSim.ExecuteSimulation()`` will show the progress bar in the
terminal.


Vizard Visualization Option
---------------------------

If you wish to transmit the simulation data to the United based `Vizard <vizard>`_ Visualization application,
then uncomment
the following line from the python scenario script. This will cause the BSK simulation data
to be stored in a binary file inside the _VizFiles sub-folder with the scenario folder. This file can be read in by
`Vizard <vizard>`_ and played back after running the BSK simulation. ::

    vizSupport.enableUnityVisualization(scSim, simTaskName, simProcessName, gravBodies=gravFactory, saveFile=fileName)

The vizInterface module must be built into BSK. This is done if the correct `CMake options <cmakeOptions>`_
are selected. The default
CMake will include this vizInterface module in the BSK build. See the BSK HTML documentation on more
information of CMake options. By using the gravFactory support class to create and add planetary bodies
the vizInterface module will automatically be able to find the correct celestial body ephemeris names.
If these names are changed, then the vizSupport.py support library has to be customized. Currently Vizard
supports playback of stored simulation data files, as well as streaming the data directly to Vizard.
By default the Viz is running in realtime mode with a 1x
speed up factor of the data playback. On the bottom right of the Vizard GUI this can be increased or decreased.
Further, some display elements such as thruster or reaction wheel panels are only visible if such devices are
being simulated in BSK.

While Vizard has many visualization features that can be customized from within the application, many
Vizard settings can also be scripted from the Basilisk python script.
A complete discussion on these options and features can be found the the `Vizard Settings <vizardSettings>`_ page.


Illustration of Simulation Results
----------------------------------

The following images illustrate the expected simulation run returns for a range of script configurations.

::

    show_plots = True, orbitCase='LEO', useSphericalHarmonics=False, planetCase='Earth'

This scenario places the spacecraft about the Earth in a LEO orbit and without considering gravitational
spherical harmonics.

    # The default CMake will include this vizInterface module in the BSK build.  See the BSK HTML documentation on
    # more information of CMake options.

    # By using the gravFactory support class to create and add planetary bodies the vizInterface module will
    # automatically be able to find the correct celestial body ephemeris names.  If these names are changed, then the
    # vizSupport.py support library has to be customized.
    # Currently Vizard supports playback of stored simulation data files as well as live streaming.
    # Further, some display elements such as thruster or reaction wheel panels are only visible if
    # such devices are being simulated in BSK.

    # While Vizard has many visualization features that can be customized from within the application, many Vizard
    # settings can also be scripted from the Basilisk python script.  A complete discussion on these options and
    # features can be found the the Vizard documentation pages.

    # Before the simulation is ready to run, it must be initialized.  The following code uses a
    # convenient macro routine
    # which initializes each BSK module (run self init, cross init and reset) and clears the BSK logging stack.

    #   and reset() routines on each module.

    # In this scenario only the translational (i.e. orbital) motion is tracked.  This means the rotational motion
    # remains at a default inertial frame orientation in this scenario.  There is no appreciable speed hit to
    # simulate both the orbital and rotational motion for a single rigid body.  In the later scenarios
    # the rotational motion is engaged by specifying rotational initial conditions, as well as rotation
    # related effectors.  In this simple scenario only translational motion is setup and tracked.
    # Further, the default spacecraft parameters, such as the unit mass and the principle inertia values are
    # just fine for this orbit simulation as they don't impact the orbital dynamics in this case.
